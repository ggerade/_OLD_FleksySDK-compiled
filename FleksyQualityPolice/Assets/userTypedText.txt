I love this new Facebook lockscreen!
Ok. Be an ass hole. Have fun with that. Its gotten you so far in life. I was just pointing out that you have a problem that you need to have checked out and you get pissy with me!? Idk wtf is your problem lately but it's ferry a really old. Don't blame me for whatever it is that's making you miserable cause it damn sure isn't me. I paid you 550 bucks this month. I'm doing more than my fair share and would be nice to be treated as such. But I still treat me like shit. When was the last time you helped me with something? You are constantly coming up with excuses to not help me. Like. Ending my oil or helping me with my new home I'm buying. Things that a good father should want to do with his son. Especially being how we didn't have that kind of relationship while I was growing up but instead your too busy. I don't have a clue with what cause your house is running down so I know it not working on it. But yet you still can't make time for anyone. And then on top of that I have to pay for pills I get from you like I'm a customer? I understand you need money, I do too. But that's still ridiculous. Connie gives her son pills w/o pay. So it's not like its some unreasonable thing. But I do it to help you. And yet this is how I get treated in return. Damn you are a fucking ass hole.

Potentially, Google could use this to disrupt the tv market. Turning your smart phone into a remote for your tv makes perfect sense. I love the price but I want more apps before I get it.

It is, and hopefully over time, more developers will implement the Casting feature using the Google Cast SDK so that you can use it for more than just Netflix, Chrome and YouTube. I watched the launch event as well as the Motorola one this morning, Google has a lot of things going for it. But as you stated, Netflix is a US service that is only just available in UK and Nordic countries, so in Spain it not available (yet) and certainly not in Cyprus - which leaves you with only chrome and Youtube 

The device you own, HTC Media Link HD does the same thing, in essence, as it mirrors your phone on the tv, and allows you to do other things while your pictures or videos locally stored in your phone are played on the tv. The only noticeable bonus for the Chromecast is that it loads things from the Internet rather than your phone. However given its low price, its not a costly experiment for the living room. I have looked into buying one simply because I don't have the media link and this is a cheap viable option. However you'd need to find out where you can purchase one

She started it all and now I'm realizing I'm flushing all my memories down the drain. The good and the bad ones all the while she's still thinking of me. 

Is it a dream 

?A bonfire of regrets that I've tried to put out. After filling it with newspaper in hopes of less doubt. Its dwindling down now my hopes are coming true. But there's one thing left that I wish to do. 

I've doused it in water, in cover, in dark. Its deep in the wilderness growing further from the cabin of my heart. The creek it runs freely with life under sun. But the fire still remains. All because she remembers my name 

So I'll start finding wood and protect it from the wind. I'll cover it through rain and salvage the ash. I'll make do with what's left and keep up what's gone. All so that I can keep what should have been done.

Do we need to arrange another evening drinking session ?
We all need tequila
Have you seen only God forgives ? If so what did you think of it ?
I've watched it. Its pretty interesting. Its not the type of film that should be shown at the mainstream cinema though. People won't get it. Not enough dialogue for the average cinema goer. Its got some gnarly themes and characters are all pretty damaged. I enjoyed it though
It reminds me of a lot of early miike where images and scenes to drive the story as opposed to dialogue
Also the main thai woman in it is fine as hell
Tequila later

As of right now it looks like the coil is out of my inventory. In the work order on my end I put in the internal notes that coil was sent to Florida for investigation. I am seeing a lot of emails now. Is there anything I need to do?

Yeah. Common is just a point at which all things can ground to in the original cloudtoid, I just soldered all the grounds to the case. Lately, I've been using a wire twist. You can also use a terminal block. Also, in my later schematics, instead of an NC switch, I just use a normally open switch on the main power. The switch just has to be rated high enough to not blow with the power of the connector. That way, you can just leave the switch pin of the okr empty instead of the NC or a step down. 
I hope someday for it to be less relevant to me.

I'm to the point where I don't enjoy these MLS All-Star games. We put together the best of the league to play a prominent from usually Europe. The problem is that we are playing a team and not a group of guys who are usually on opposite sides of the ball. I don't like it and it makes our league look horrible.

I'm really not fond of the All-Star set up. Rather see an East versus West match.

I would not consider myself as a right wing fundamentalist. I am a Christ follower. I believe that somewhere down the line, evangelicals got added into this definition. As an evangelical Christian, I am called to evangelize. The writer was dedicating this piece to conservatives and trying to contrast them with liberal Christians.I feel that he sees only two groups of Christians that are opposite each other. However, there is more than the two groups. I know because I don't fit in either. Between you and I, though I am jobless, we tithe and even support a young boy in a very impoverished nation. As a family, we try to love others as ourselves, with our hands and feet and with what financial blessings we've been allotted by Jesus Christ. I do believe in a literal 6 days of Creation, but don't do so blindly. We have been tasked by our Creator God to take care of the Earth. As for war, I do believe there are legitimate reasons to fight, but I don't know if I have seen one since Hitler tried to take over the world and eradicate races. I am not for the American dream, but see it as a tool of Satan. God is first above family and money. However, I have been entrusted with many blessings and am called by God to be a good steward of them. See Ephesians 5. Women and men do have different roles. This doesn't mean they are to be confined to the house barefoot and pregnant. They are man's counterpart and helper. As Genesis states, He made both of them in His image. Just as Christ is God and equal to God. So is woman to man. Jesus submitted to God and His will. The wife is to do likewise. This doesn't mean I dictate everything, but rather we are to work together and if there is a disagreement with our direction, I am to seek council from the Lord in prayer. He works hearts and can change even the man's heart to understand the woman. 
I could go on and on. All of this to say I'm glad I'm like neither the writer or the subject. My problem with the liberal Christian worldview is that it fails to live up to the mandate given to us by Christ in Acts 1:8. It's all about a political view. As for the right wingers, they also have bastardized the Gospel with their worldview. Both fail to love their neighbor.

Thanks to the dev for this one. It's a very lightweight and minimalistic approach to sms/mms which is great considering all the bloated sms/mms apps out there. I love the way it handlesn picture messages, filling the entire "bubble" with content.   My only request: MMS over Wifi DOES work, but only if you still have data enabled in the background. I like to have keep my data turned off while my Wifi is on to conserve battery. Under these circumstances (wifi on, data off) the stock messaging app knows to enab

That's cool. 
So, what makes her your girl? :)
Ahhhh...got it. Sneaking through the woods huh? 
Oh so it was like a nature hike? :)
I am just messing with you. So when do you see her next? 
So she is a redneck woman? 
Ok
Let me see if Val has any questions? 
Yeah she is cute 
She thinks we have covered everything for now. 
Hahaha. That made her laugh. 
And she said you are out of the will. 
And something about adopting a little Korean boy.

Looks like the phone had nothing to do with our texting issues. 
I am done with my 8. I have 2 more this morning and 2 this afternoon. 
I didn't. 
I guess I will call them back. Grrr. 
We should definitely go. We will bring the wine holders this time too! 
Oh gosh. I have no idea. I am terrible at that stuff. I would be happy to contribute though.

That probably works. If we are going to trade you can definitely up my contribution!

Just finished eating. I need to do the same! 
Thanks Dana. I can handle validation and remediation if needed when I get to the store in the am. 
That's my plan too. I am doing half day on Friday so I plan on busting it out Friday and Saturday morning. 
9343

I sure do miss you sweetie!

Yeah, I think I am done too. I have one more load of laundry to swap out though.

I am all swapped and in bed now!

Yay! I am glad everyone is ok!

Ok. Did you want to be there too or should I just have him come whenever? 
Ok sweetie. I wasn't sure how long you were planning on staying at the retirement. 
Are you sure that is the right number? 
That makes it nice! 
Hahaha that's ok! 
Apparently no one else has it yet so they were just getting rejected! 
I am home now so whenever is best for you. 
Do you need directions or did Val already tell you how to get here? 
Ok. 1113 St Andrews Ct Akron 44312 
Ok. I'll be here. 
Mike is going to come now. Well sort of. He has to stop at home first and get gas. 
Hahaha! I am beginning to wonder if I will get to see you tonight! ;)
Me too baby! 
Just got home. I am so sleepy tonight! 
That would feel wonderful! 
And I bet whatever came after would feel even better! 
All done with mike! 
Yeah it went fine. 
Should I head your way? 
I would be happy to come to you since I am all done. 
Ok! I might have to stop for gas but we will see! 
Ok. I am on my way. I think I am going to need to stop. 
Ok!

I miss you already! 
I like it much better when I am there too! 
I know just what you mean! I can't wait for vacation to start!

I would like to be apart of the fall volleyball season. Let me know what the fees are and I will have it paid as soon as possible. I think there was another email I needed to reply to about a dinner or party, but I can't remember what the details where. If it was about availability then I am free any day at the moment.

Canceled Plans 
I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning so playing in the fall softball league may be difficult. 

I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning. It should be roughly a thirty day job but can always turn into more or less. I will know more next week, but I wanted to let you know asap so you can make the right decision for the team to maybe move me back to a substitute. The job could end before the season starts but like I said I'll know a little more next week. 
Back to Lafayette for work come Monday. It should be more profitable this time, lol.

I should be able to make it to the game then! They switched me to work in Terre Haute for four tens! Yes, I love four tens.

@PopeSnogginheim that's all I've been saying, too. Don't be a coward about it. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries we've indoctrinated western culture? Because I think most cultures are male dominated and sorely overlooked the importance of respecting women in general. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries Black American culture has indoctrinated western civilization's culture? It seems most cultures, globally, are male dominated and most have sorely overlooked and downplayed the importance of respecting women and how important women are to any society in general. 
To go further; it seems this lack of respect/recognition of importance, is more damaging to black women. Stereotypically, black women already have such a damaged reputation (which I don't subscribe to personally), depsite the fact this idea of black women being relegated to baby mama's, gold diggers, and women of promiscuity aren't true in the majority of cases. 
I think the truth -like with most stereotypes- is that a small percentage of women validate a false overarching stereotype that imprison the majority of women who aren't really like that. 
Am I wrong for viewing it this way? I am not a woman (no surprise), so I don't know what women go through, but I would like a better understanding. 
I think all people under the boot of malicious stereotypes and damaging reputations seem to put this faux sense of responsibility and intense pressure on themselves to fix or change a problem that most likely isn't theirs to begin with...

I thought Vick said he forgave Cooper and that LeSean McCoy said that it was too big. I could be wrong. 

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--michael-vick-helping-to-clean-up-riley-cooper-s-mess-193236048.html 

To change direction... It's strange how some of the same people who generally never forgave Vick for what he did, are now rushing to decide what is and isn't forgivable for others coupled with how quickly they should move on. But the N-word is the double standard they want to focus on?
How overt is enough?

A lifetime ban is excessive, because I do believe people have the capacity to change.... but since we are focusing this on Vick's story; anyone care to talk about the hypocrisy of never forgiving Vick, but demanding people get over this and forgive Cooper because he apologized? Vick apologized to and did his time.

That said at least Cooper's apology seemed genuine and he wasn't looking to blame the usual suspects (pun intended) for his own doing.

[quote="Gonzo"]Warren Sapp was a one-of-a-kind defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his bust in Canton will be the first of its kind.

Sapp could have been bald on his bust. He had that look for most of his years in Tampa Bay, actually, and had a shaved head for his biggest moment, when the Buccaneers won a Super Bowl. He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe?

[quote="BoogieOnDa360"][quote="NYG Hitstick"]Michael Vick, who said on Wednesday that he had forgiven Cooper, acknowledged on Thursday that emotions were running high and a volatile situation wasn't going to settle down any time soon.

"I tried to defuse it for a day, but I can't make it go away," Vick told reporters via ESPN the Magazine. "I can't do that. It's too big."

Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but how is this Vick backing off the forgiveness train? All he said is that he can't make the situation go away, which is true. He said he forgave him. What more is he supposed to do? And what does him being an ex-con have to do with him being offended. I guess he loses that right from now huh? McCoy is the one saying that he doesn't respect Cooper anymore. Shouldn't that be the headline?[/quote]

[quote="Gonzo"]Warren Sapp was a one-of-a-kind defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his bust in Canton will be the first of its kind.

Sapp could have been bald on his bust. He had that look for most of his years in Tampa Bay, actually, and had a shaved head for his biggest moment, when the Buccaneers won a Super Bowl. He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe? Maybe not... Are there any busts in Canton with bad hairstyles from the 80's and 90's? Like Mullets or high rights- low lefts aka gumby, or rat tails?

In her defense, she campaigned hard to be the monkey in Choke.
@KristiNoem PRISM. Irony.
And Marie Mathews is 16 years old and a Conneticut teenager at Archie Andrews High School. She's editor of the school paper and has a shot to graduate early, with an academic scholarship. Which bugs her. 
Why? The first semester is almost over, and she's doing very well. This is the first year being head of the class is possible. It nags at her though, because her old friend and neighbor Angel Glover used to be first in their class. 
Angel had been the top student, but then over the summer his Dad was in an incident with a mugger and was shot dead. Angel apparently hasn't been dealing with it very well; he shows up late to class constantly, and he wears heavy sweaters constantly to apparently cover bruises. Rumors persist that he's getting into drugs or gangs; harsher rumors sat he's prostituting himself. 
And isn't one to believe rumors though, and tries reaching out to her friend. She's also a little curious where they stand, because they made out a little at a Fourth of July harvests, before his Dad died. Angel is very curt though, brushing her off. 
The scholarship Ann wants typically goes to whoever wins the Science Award at the end of the year. She has competition from Angel, as well as Irene, who is much more ruthless than either. Items would rather not have her competition be a factor anymore.

The keyboard is definitely snappier, and the new settings are amazing. (whenever I try to intentionally miss the space, and enter a new word, it doesn't work, but that isn't a feature that was absolutely necessary... So, awesome work guys! )
One suggestion. Most of the time, I don't really miss the space, but the keyboard registers it as a few separate letters. 

Like, 

"Fleksy is awesome! " 

Becomes 

Fleksy isgjaersome 

Between is and awesome, the keyboard registered the letters gj, or gh, or hj. 

Would it be possible for the keyboard to recognise when this happens, and change "isgjawesome" to "is awesome" 

It would be a really neat feature, what do you think guys?

     Everyone was pointing out at something in the distance, with terrified faces. Aditya got up from his seat, made his way through the crowd, while maintaining his balance in the shaky local train. Local trains in India, are quite different, compared to other countries. The biggest difference being that their doors are always open, whether the train is stationary, or moving. And the trains shook a lot. Enough to make a person unable to maintain balance without holding on to something.

Haha should be fun. Plus we can hang out with Kinkade. 
I think 1025 but I'm not sure. Can you ask them how nothing is owed? That makes no sense. 
Yeah sounds good 
I just paid the 15 yesterday. So did you pay the 1000+ on mine or are we going to wait until it says we owe? 
Alrighty 
Thanks babe. 
Its 125 to fix the tv 
Hey dad we found a 42 inch plasma tv. It has no base so it would probably have to be mounted. Its 125 to fix the green color of the screen. Other than that it's a nice tv. Not sure if it's worth it and we probably can't put it up anywhere until we move what do you think? 
Yeah we got a free estimate from a tv repair place
Checked 4 other places and they charged 40-50 for an estimate 
Yeah found next to dumpster. 
Okay. Its pretty heavy for being so flat. I think it will be nice mounted though
He offered to store it in the attic. So maybe. 
Don't think it would fit in our room anywhere do you?

Works great on the Asus transformer prime. It runs very smooth and the features are awesome. I love having the ability could set your own wallpaper though, instead of just having the default ones.  Edit: I also tested it out on my Nexus 4 and liked it as well. The more I use it the more I like it. There is room for improvement though. Just one example is that when you switch from landscape to portrait mode (or vise versa) the widgets don't flip the way one would expect. Keep up the good work though.

Ok won't bother u anymore. 
Yeah it was probably a pinched nerve, that shit will Fuck u up
Yeah but your sisters may have the wrong type of life insurance. Let me call them, if it ain't broke I won't fix it. But what if their policy don't work the way they think it does or if I can give them more coverage for the same price or the same coverage for cheaper. U never know I've seen so many horror stories, there are alot of fucked up insurance companies out there. 
What's good man how u been?
We also do investments too, so they may be interested in that 
Your package is here and what's up with that lady Kim and Hazel, I need some business lady.

U right about that! 
What's up my boy, everything all good with u?
Don't know bro, I'm pretty much done with that illegal shit. 
LOL u will wear it or shit will get physical, u ain't bout that life! LOL 
That's a possibility. I got my kids now till maybe around that time. My mom may get them though. Let me know when u get off. 
But I'll holler at u, I still do know alot of people in my biz that burn that good. So maybe I can hook u up but I ain't dealing. My past ways got me where I'm at so I'm trying to stay disciplined in my new lane.

Well we got something in common, my baby mamma ain't shit! LOL 
I know, that shit can be rough trust me I know. I have other challenges besides my kids and sometimes I feel like jumping off a bridge! LOL but just focus on the good because whatever u focus on grows whether it's negative or positive! 
If u ever need someone to talk to to cheer u up, I'm always here any time! 
It'll take some time but once u emotionally detach yourself from them and they know they ain't got you by the balls (so to speak), that basically they can't affect you anymore. All of a sudden shit magically changes. Either way it's a win win for u! And we've been split about 10 months. 
Yeah in due time... Yep she is
Like immediately after we split too, she is the type that has to be with someone to feel good about herself
At that point I didn't give a Fuck, its weird I'd have to explain it. U wanna talk?
I have a Google voice line that's different from my number, but he should see text messages too then right? 
I can see the numbers tested on my phone carrier, not the messages but just who they texted 
LOL I won't, u want me to call u now?

It'll be like three four years after Rises that this is gonna come out so technically it's not that short of a time gap.

Really excellent website, I've really been enjoying it a lot. You can read a lot of supplementary material for free online, but the episodes are pretty great as stand alone. Let me know if you're listening to any of them so we can talk about the episodes! 

Love you guys, great talk today!

This is very nice indeed! I really like the Fleksy keyboard but unfortunately it doesn't support the German language. 
max

@fleksy This keyboard experience is amazing! Adding German is on 6th spot in your requests. How fast do you think this could be added?

@trade605 indeed. I really have no idea why it does that. Super annoying. 
@Teslief @insanj exactly. Worked fine on 6.0 but after upgrading to 6.1.2 they won't save.. Haven't found a way to fix this. 
So it's around 2pm. Hope that damn tweet about my battery won't pop up again. :/
@DEATHmeNEVER :D
Okay from now on I'll call you an ambulance 
@insanj always the same. Got that too often. -.-

Ah. Well in on my nexus 7 so that isn't really practical. 
I'd moan back as you gave me the chills. I'd then slowly slide your panties off as I kissed my way back down to your waist. I'd pull one of your legs over my shoulder as kissed your pussy. Slowly I'd lick with my tongue as my hands grabbed your butt and boobs.

Katie, 

Ostensibly, the HAIMS deployment at Lackland is supposed to start in a little over a month. I have not received invites to any PIM calls. Does this mean that the training dates might be getting pushed? 

Also, has there been any word, yet, on the rescheduling of Dover or Edwards? 

Thanks, 

Tom

Hey Aunty Tish! Apologies for the lack of communication. I was in Texas last week and it was a blur handling communication in Hawaii and in Texas at the same time.

Greetings! So... I found a way to automate entries from Wufoo to Basecamp. Ju temporarily broke our Wufoo form, which is why we haven't been getting anything lately. But now no need check insert Wufoo requests. Wohoo.

Are we planning to keep Basecamp? 
Okay 

Linked them together CIA a third

Hmmm. 
Same focus on culture. From there, I feel like I can trust your guys path making. 
The culture of the conference - I felt incredibly at home there with such a focus in this subculture . Schedule was great and manageable -- never felt like I was struggling through the sessions. The choice of speakers were great. Main sessions were total winners as well, really hitting on areas I encounter. There really seemed to be a consistent theme of the battle of the mind. Conference staff and servants were amazing -- really felt like I was apart of the experience with them instead of just being an observer. Having Pastor Matt Chandler was a perfect session to end the conference.

Greetings! Sorry about Saturday. We had a missions night after service. It was awesome! But I'm sure I also missed a whole bucket of awesome with you guys too. 

Hey really quick. We are having our equip and inspire conference from August 13th to 15th. You should come! And anyone else in your church that is interested. Its a personal and ministry development conference. Also, I'm working with Studio Red to develop one of our breakouts which is focused on visual story telling through film.. And all of life. If you or anyone else is interested... Let me know! 
Tish
Good morning! Hope you are well with the house cleaning up and stuff. Quick question.. Do we need to feed the miniature fish anything? 
Doug
Hey Uncle Doug. Welcome back! A few questions : 

Could we get the keys for the garage door and the back door? 

We noticed there's a grill in the front yard. Are you guys planning to take that up? 

The fan in Marisa's former room is wobbling at certain speeds. Are we allowed to attempt to balance it? 

And finally, is there anything we can arrange and help you guys out with your move? At your new house and here? 
Got it. No keys necessary in that case. I'll ask the guys if they each want individual alarm and door codes. 

Cool, I'll take a look at the fan. 

I'll check with the others about the yard. I'll let you know if anyone is up for it. I'll gladly help out. When were you thinking?

Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago.

If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society.
Where are you

Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous.
Haha okay
Kay
Is this chando
Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Afif Mulla <afifmulla@gmail.com>, 
Most of us have been in a situation where they have found themselves wanting more with a friend, physically of course. For me it was my best friend which morphed nicely into a full blown relationship. 


Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago. Industries like porn are booming, sex toys are slowly becoming something of a normal shopping experience. Sex is no longer a taboo subject area.  


So with all that taken into consideration its becoming a lot easier for friends to become friends that fuck. But does it last? Is it really that easy and emotionless? Or will someone end up getting hurt? 


How to get into that situation? 


Well unlike a relationship there is no commitment, you think just sex would be appealing to anyone, you're wrong. Some people know they are full of emotion and therefore it wouldn't work for them. Others feel that they could do it, but they probably will get attached and finally they are well up for it.  


Don't be mistaken into thinking someone who agrees to this situation immediately is the wrong choice. After all, they only want what you want emotionless sex. 


Unlike relationships asking someone shouldn't be a task, it shouldn't feel like a big deal, you'd be choosing a friend you wanted to have sex with already and if the situation is female to male I bet most males would jump at the chance. 


Is it 'slaggy'? 


Well of course you're a whore male or female, after all, you want your friend plowing you or allowing you to plow them, over no stronger attraction than just friends.  


If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society. 


Will this stay as sex for both parties? 


Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

The second one wasn't about a fat guy but yes same idea. 
Indeed. What I was talking about comes more into play when someone wants to lose "trouble fat" aka that last sliver of fat that makes your abs stay concealed. 

Obviously people with an obesity problem need to straight up cut calories. I'm just saying other factors influence how quickly you can lose weight especially if you're body is well maintained. 
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, 
Should I overclock in a m-itx build (such as the Prodigy)? Because it seems like everything would overheat in such a small and confined space, but maybe I'm wrong (probably). Also, even if I don't overclock should I get the 4670k over the 4670 due to it being better or something? Or just go with the 4670? Also,c what's the best m-itx board for the 4670? One more question I have is, if I do overclock a 4670k in a m-itx build, should I use a closed loop cooler such as the H50 or will an aftermarket heatsink be enough? Thanks guys.

With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, if you want a CLC, you might as well go for a bigger one like an h100i or else air coolers will work equally well for less noise. The Phanteks tc-12dx is a great cpu cooler. 
White cases are sexy. We need more good monitors in white to match them. 
If someone isn't saving money, they could still get a z87 with a locked processor for the extra features.

Par for the course with Google though. 
I also believe Xperia ZR uses that SoC as well. 
I don't want bigger batteries as much as I want good battery life. Unlike a lot of people here, a compact and thin phone is in fact desirable in my eyes. I won't buy a phone thicker than 10mm and bigger batteries also means longer charge times. 

Technically, we need new battery tech that has greater energy density. 

Also, battery life is like the one thing moto does well with its phones. 
Sounds like the moto x. I feel like they really missed the mark on price. 
A shitty one at that. 
I bought a 120GB ipod and threw my entire music collection on it. Then I realized I got skip syndrome because of that. Returned it and got an 8GB Sandisk and an mSD card and reorganized songs into playlists. Life is better now. 

Personally I just want 32GB on my phone.

We have very few assault rifles as it costs so much in taxes and takes months for the paper work to clear. We have plenty of civilian rifles like the ar15 platform and other semiauto rifles though.

That and wouldn't those with said rifles be more likely to an apocalypse

No, I got the screw on top. I actually found it at TJ Maxx. Works perfectly fine for me. Its pretty sturdy. The green plastic is thick and hard, but it feels like the brittle type. It'd take a lot to break it, but I don't think breaking the handle would be out of the question of you dropped it from a fair height onto solid concrete. Its not Nalgene sturdy, but I can't imagine breaking it in any kind of ordinary way. 

Also, sometimes water can get in between the wood and the glass. There are air holes in the plastic on the bottom of the bottle to mitigate this, but if you get the wood soaking wet, you'll just have to take the pieces apart and let them dry individually.

Frankly, if they used rubberized plastics and rubber instead of the hard plastic and bamboo, this thing would be indestructible and totally awesome. That's probably go against their "green" bottle mantra, though.

That was from memory. And I started playing BioShock less than two weeks ago. I just really love that speech. 


Also, as someone who has obviously played the first BioShock, if I just reached Heapheastos, how long do I have until I reach the end? Please don't spoil anything, I already know too much.

Do you guys think this is a cavity?

Hello, 
A few questions about my teeth. 
Hello, I am here to ask a few questions about my teeth. 


First of all, some background. I am a thirteen year old male who has had braces. I still have wires behind some of my teeth in the front. I generally do a good at brushing my teeth, and have started flossing nightly after my last visit to the dentist. I have never had a cavity. 


Alright, time for some questions. 


Does [this] (http://imgur.com/H5Jc6PN) appear to be a cavity? I would find this very odd for I do not eat sweets and have always done a pretty good job at keeping my teeth clean. I also saw the dentist less than a week ago and she said that screening looked good, but I should floss to make sure my gums stay healthy. 


If it were to be a cavity, how would I go about getting rid of it? I really don't want to to have it drilled and filled, for it is only a tiny brown spot on the tooth. 


Are there natural ways to get rid of cavities? I ask because I have seen many articles about this. 


If the picture I have supplied does not give a good enough view, I can try to get a better one. 


Thank you for any answers you give.

No, I noticed it about two days after seeing the dentist. Also, a quick question. How serious is tooth decay? I've heard it can be fixed relatively easily.

Would you eat the bark or rub it on the tooth? I've also heard that cod liver oil can completely fix cavities. Have you heard anything about that? Do you think it could fix tooth decay too?

Well that's true but I mean, Staten Island has Dairy Queen. Or is getting one. But it's probably just as easy to go to Ohio.

I had a vision while drinking, you should check that pocket 
Oh, don't sweat it. It was a whim that passed pretty quick, washing my bedding like a human :)
Did you check it? 
Different meds
You should watch the bridge, it features my new tv crush (guess I'm already over jons brother)
Worth checking... 
You? 
It was a fun birthday, at no point was I overwhelmed with people, and nobody stuck around long enough to hate me :)
Wanna hang, got some wash to finish

Without space to toss and 
Without space to toss and turn, I go strait to sleep :)
I only saw one gecko when I was+there, lots of anoles though
I assume the wildlife is regional, and they'd have a lot of competition for food, so it wouldn't shock me. The anoles you can wear as earings, because they'll clamp down and not let go :)
Cuz the weather is hell?

My pops isn't playing until ten now because spark is lame
When's your party? I'll probably be late, but I'll get the us there early 
Pa
Ok, I was gonna mention the show was moved to super late, but I'm still into happy hour. I'll focus on being extra drakee tomarrow
Till be there? 
I don't mind either of those things :)
I'm going to be there, I've been working nights :(
My beard is at ultimate gross stage, cuz I'm growing it (though I suppose you saw that Saturday), also, haven't drank some Sunday, yay
You? 
Cuz they don't know you failed at shower :)
Also, pops is playing at the riverfront tonight, a female friend will probably be there
No, shirly
Weren't you all I want to have female friends I envy you? She's about as single as I am
Sara? 
I couldn't handle that
My lie about mere poking
I'll Prolly be lingering in the area all evening
Oh, yeah, that's how I'd do it... 
Yep, on the river
Pretty sure one getting oysters, then I'll probably linger to iron hill
Sarahs doing happy hour, but gonna cut out early, I think Scali said fuck ten o'clock, Jon may be coming out
Anyway, you can try your magic of you want. I am pretty sure she gives everyone a date no matter what, I can't determine how she decides who to date again and fuck 
Yeah, me too, I'm Prolly getting drunk in the parking lot
Now she's hedging on coming out
You coming out tonight? 
Ok, whatever you feel like
Yes, thanks. 
Are you bringing people? Pops wants people if you know any, the late night fucked them 
Huh ?
It's so late :)
Hah, the combinations are super popular too
He plays at ten, I'm doing happy hour, but then wandering for ahwhile
River front
So, happy hour or you too nap time puppy?

Are you here still? 
Yeag
That's what female friends are... 
I'm home safe, let me know when yi

I'm home safe, let me know when you are lady. Thanks so much for coming out, hope you had fun
I will
You too 
Sweet dreams when the time comes, and good times until 
Ps, tell James he's a Cunt for not coming 
Even with a crooked face? 
So she's said to me
I'm so drunk, hope this drawing works
I'm home, she's at her boys, and she already said you liked her
Also said a 60 percent chance she shows on Saturday separate from me, but she won't bump Molly so... 
Huh? 
She said you smell bad, I assume you're out
Shirley griffens I think
Thinks what? 
Fucking pink shirt didn't believe we weren't when Shirley was trying to wing man it for me
She was like you have a girlfriend here, I was like huh, and she was like that bitch rubbing on me, and I was like in single, she was like oh, that game 
Yeah, that boy was a frined apperwnkry 
Like Shirley and I... 
I've never heard of a parent being accused of abuse for spanking unless they were the type to do kindly the time to the point that they were hiding actual abuse under the guise of legit punishment 
You're such a good wing man, and apparently a total cock block
Yeah, it was still funny
I feel great 
Perfect amount of hangover to feel like rebirt
H
He's a good guy
She told me off for saying I was single in front of my girlfriend hahahahaha
But you were literally right there in the conversation. 
No way I could lie like that, I lie through ommission and obfuscation, not to the face
Well it's lunch time it's gotta be close, if it's like happy hour, whatever
Omg, epic awkward couple photo
Marriage :)
They DO NOT like each other
Which zoo? 
Bring your tiger poking stick
They have otters
And an awesome bird
Who did? 
They DO NOT like each other
I didn't get close enough
It must be nice to be a girl, you get to rub on everyone and no one cares
Yeah, such an awesome super power
I face booked you the photo
Did we (I) not look like hell this time for the spark photo? Maybe we'll be in it
No, it's tall and colour full, and we looked each other in the eyes and paced together
Scottlan
I'd murder babies for the super power of welcome rubbing
You know it's true, I have no morals and like to rub... 
Do I win awkward couple bingo? 
Landemberg
Like newark basically
I really like human contact
It's true
Pretty sure, ps, that may mean the bird collection is gone from the zoo
No, they were sitting bored
I don't think people think we don't like each other when they see us

S4 doesn't have an spen... S3 is better than iPhone 5. S4 just humiliates it. The iPhone looks nice and its metal. But it scratches easily and you can get dents. The s4 is plastic but it's more likely to survive a fall. The iPhone is super simple. But by being simple it limits what you can do with it. The s4 or really any android phone is YOUR phone. If you want your favourite song as a ringtone... No problem. Want to bluetooth something.. A friend.. Easy want to listen to radio no mathata.. The list goes on and on

The long press for symbols is great, but is there a way to move from one row to the next without having to release, backspace to erase the symbol you didn't want, and then trying a different row? 

For instance, right now I'm not sure whether the @ symbol is on the middle or bottom row - so I longpress middle, and discover that it's not there. At this point I'd ideally like to keep holding down my finger and move it to the bottom row and discover the symbol I want is over there, move my finger to it, and finally release to get just the symbol I wanted.

If you don't know don't comment like you do know

You mean microsoft commercials? Because every article I've read mentions their mistake. 
x36
The name itself is bias. And the mere fact that they mention the mistake shows that they know people aren't over it. And until microsoft can change this pr disaster they will be prone to attacks like this. I understand where you come from that this subreddit wants them to fail.

Its not magic. Its skill ;)

RFID
RFID stands for Radio-Frequency IDentification. The acronym refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying 2,000 bytes of data or less.

How RFID Works

How does RFID work? A Radio-Frequency IDentification system has three parts:

A scanning antenna
A transceiver with a decoder to interpret the data
A transponder - the RFID tag - that has been programmed with information.
The scanning antenna puts out radio-frequency signals in a relatively short range. The RF radiation does two things:
It provides a means of communicating with the transponder (the RFID tag) AND
It provides the RFID tag with the energy to communicate (in the case of passive RFID tags).
This is an absolutely key part of the technology; RFID tags do not need to contain batteries, and can therefore remain usable for very long periods of time (maybe decades).
The scanning antennas can be permanently affixed to a surface; handheld antennas are also available. They can take whatever shape you need; for example, you could build them into a door frame to accept data from persons or objects passing through.

When an RFID tag passes through the field of the scanning antenna, it detects the activation signal from the antenna. That "wakes up" the RFID chip, and it transmits the information on its microchip to be picked up by the scanning antenna.

In addition, the RFID tag may be of one of two types. Active RFID tags have their own power source; the advantage of these tags is that the reader can be much farther away and still get the signal. Even though some of these devices are built to have up to a 10 year life span, they have limited life spans. Passive RFID tags, however, do not require batteries, and can be much smaller and have a virtually unlimited life span.

RFID tags can be read in a wide variety of circumstances, where barcodes or other optically read technologies are useless.

The tag need not be on the surface of the object (and is therefore not subject to wear)
The read time is typically less than 100 milliseconds
Large numbers of tags can be read at once rather than item by item.
