S4 doesn't have an spen... S3 is better than iPhone 5. S4 just humiliates it. The iPhone looks nice and its metal. But it scratches easily and you can get dents. The s4 is plastic but it's more likely to survive a fall. The iPhone is super simple. But by being simple it limits what you can do with it. The s4 or really any android phone is YOUR phone. If you want your favourite song as a ringtone... No problem. Want to bluetooth something.. A friend.. Easy want to listen to radio no mathata.. The list goes on and on

The long press for symbols is great, but is there a way to move from one row to the next without having to release, backspace to erase the symbol you didn't want, and then trying a different row? 

For instance, right now I'm not sure whether the @ symbol is on the middle or bottom row - so I longpress middle, and discover that it's not there. At this point I'd ideally like to keep holding down my finger and move it to the bottom row and discover the symbol I want is over there, move my finger to it, and finally release to get just the symbol I wanted.

You mean microsoft commercials? Because every article I've read mentions their mistake.

The name itself is bias. And the mere fact that they mention the mistake shows that they know people aren't over it. And until microsoft can change this pr disaster they will be prone to attacks like this. I understand where you come from that this subreddit wants them to fail.

Those are the only ones I can think of, but if you're worried about time, I can assure you that antutu only takes 10ish minutes. 
I prefer it over skype just because of the free group video calls. But yes, I think I can list 5 design flaws (at least) with hangouts android app off the top of my head. And why in the name of spaghetti doesn't it have a desktop client yet? 
I'm sorry, what is this for? I haven't been able to check messages for about a week and don't know what you're asking me to link... 
Yay! Enjoy! 
I know, but I'm talking about like an entire client like skype has. 
It definitely got to do with something you installed. I'm lazy, so I'd also factory reset just to fix it, but it'll be an issue with whatever you recently updated or installed. 
I'm with you, man. It's so painful to wait... 
Not really, but always make sure it works before you buy it and if you think it does and then it doesn't just demand a refund.

I'm going to vote for the htc one on this one. The camera is beyond phenomenal and its wicked fast. Also, it has a ton of awesome ROMs and nods if you're into rooting. 
Now playing 

I can confirm that it's really light. I can use it for hours on wifi with little drain compared subreddit sync. 
It's in the best release, and the dev is constantly updating it, so I'm expecting it within the next week or so! 
Why do the icons under posts not look embedded anymore? Is it supposed to be like this? It looks kind of funky and I liked it when they looked like a part of the cards.

RFID
RFID stands for Radio-Frequency IDentification. The acronym refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying 2,000 bytes of data or less.

How RFID Works

How does RFID work? A Radio-Frequency IDentification system has three parts:

A scanning antenna
A transceiver with a decoder to interpret the data
A transponder - the RFID tag - that has been programmed with information.
The scanning antenna puts out radio-frequency signals in a relatively short range. The RF radiation does two things:
It provides a means of communicating with the transponder (the RFID tag) AND
It provides the RFID tag with the energy to communicate (in the case of passive RFID tags).
This is an absolutely key part of the technology; RFID tags do not need to contain batteries, and can therefore remain usable for very long periods of time (maybe decades).
The scanning antennas can be permanently affixed to a surface; handheld antennas are also available. They can take whatever shape you need; for example, you could build them into a door frame to accept data from persons or objects passing through.

When an RFID tag passes through the field of the scanning antenna, it detects the activation signal from the antenna. That "wakes up" the RFID chip, and it transmits the information on its microchip to be picked up by the scanning antenna.

In addition, the RFID tag may be of one of two types. Active RFID tags have their own power source; the advantage of these tags is that the reader can be much farther away and still get the signal. Even though some of these devices are built to have up to a 10 year life span, they have limited life spans. Passive RFID tags, however, do not require batteries, and can be much smaller and have a virtually unlimited life span.

RFID tags can be read in a wide variety of circumstances, where barcodes or other optically read technologies are useless.

The tag need not be on the surface of the object (and is therefore not subject to wear)
The read time is typically less than 100 milliseconds
Large numbers of tags can be read at once rather than item by item.

Ok. Be an ass hole. Have fun with that. Its gotten you so far in life. I was just pointing out that you have a problem that you need to have checked out and you get pissy with me!? Idk wtf is your problem lately but it's ferry a really old. Don't blame me for whatever it is that's making you miserable cause it damn sure isn't me. I paid you 550 bucks this month. I'm doing more than my fair share and would be nice to be treated as such. But I still treat me like shit. When was the last time you helped me with something? You are constantly coming up with excuses to not help me. Like. Ending my oil or helping me with my new home I'm buying. Things that a good father should want to do with his son. Especially being how we didn't have that kind of relationship while I was growing up but instead your too busy. I don't have a clue with what cause your house is running down so I know it not working on it. But yet you still can't make time for anyone. And then on top of that I have to pay for pills I get from you like I'm a customer? I understand you need money, I do too. But that's still ridiculous. Connie gives her son pills w/o pay. So it's not like its some unreasonable thing. But I do it to help you. And yet this is how I get treated in return. Damn you are a fucking ass hole.

Had my appointment at Property Management today, but left feeling slightly suspicious of their possible agendas. 
After looking at their website, I discovered that it is a family run business and this makes me distinctly uncomfortable. It is these sorts of service providors that can stab you in the back at a moments notice. I might have a look at some of the properties that they have, but I will be a little dubious of them period.

It is, and hopefully over time, more developers will implement the Casting feature using the Google Cast SDK so that you can use it for more than just Netflix, Chrome and YouTube. I watched the launch event as well as the Motorola one this morning, Google has a lot of things going for it. But as you stated, Netflix is a US service that is only just available in UK and Nordic countries, so in Spain it not available (yet) and certainly not in Cyprus - which leaves you with only chrome and Youtube 

The device you own, HTC Media Link HD does the same thing, in essence, as it mirrors your phone on the tv, and allows you to do other things while your pictures or videos locally stored in your phone are played on the tv. The only noticeable bonus for the Chromecast is that it loads things from the Internet rather than your phone. However given its low price, its not a costly experiment for the living room. I have looked into buying one simply because I don't have the media link and this is a cheap viable option. However you'd need to find out where you can purchase one  

Love Hugo!

Do we need to arrange another evening drinking session ?
We all need tequila
Have you seen only God forgives ? If so what did you think of it ?
I've watched it. Its pretty interesting. Its not the type of film that should be shown at the mainstream cinema though. People won't get it. Not enough dialogue for the average cinema goer. Its got some gnarly themes and characters are all pretty damaged. I enjoyed it though
It reminds me of a lot of early miike where images and scenes to drive the story as opposed to dialogue
Also the main thai woman in it is fine as hell
Tequila later

As of right now it looks like the coil is out of my inventory. In the work order on my end I put in the internal notes that coil was sent to Florida for investigation. I am seeing a lot of emails now. Is there anything I need to do?

Okay. 

The lock in is this Friday at 7. 
Unfortunately we can only have kids in the benson and bailey youth groups and their parents or guardians be apart this time around. 
We will provide pizza and drinks. If you want other snacks please bring them. Feel free to bring any appropriate movies and games. 
If you play an instrument and want to practice together please do bring it. 
Bring your own bedding. 
And parents please pick up your child by 10am. 
Hope to see many of you this weekend!

Well, I wiped it and, upon signing back into your ID, everything came back and there is a system update available. Victory. 
Yeah. Common is just a point at which all things can ground to in the original cloudtoid, I just soldered all the grounds to the case. Lately, I've been using a wire twist. You can also use a terminal block. Also, in my later schematics, instead of an NC switch, I just use a normally open switch on the main power. The switch just has to be rated high enough to not blow with the power of the connector. That way, you can just leave the switch pin of the okr empty instead of the NC or a step down. 
I hope someday for it to be less relevant to me. 
Wow. JBQ quit. A sad day for Android.

I'm to the point where I don't enjoy these MLS All-Star games. We put together the best of the league to play a prominent from usually Europe. The problem is that we are playing a team and not a group of guys who are usually on opposite sides of the ball. I don't like it and it makes our league look horrible.

I'm really not fond of the All-Star set up. Rather see an East versus West match.

Too good for MLS? Isn't this what we as fans of the meadow long for; great players coming to improve the quality of the game in America? Take pride in this.

I would not consider myself as a right wing fundamentalist. I am a Christ follower. I believe that somewhere down the line, evangelicals got added into this definition. As an evangelical Christian, I am called to evangelize. The writer was dedicating this piece to conservatives and trying to contrast them with liberal Christians.I feel that he sees only two groups of Christians that are opposite each other. However, there is more than the two groups. I know because I don't fit in either. Between you and I, though I am jobless, we tithe and even support a young boy in a very impoverished nation. As a family, we try to love others as ourselves, with our hands and feet and with what financial blessings we've been allotted by Jesus Christ. I do believe in a literal 6 days of Creation, but don't do so blindly. We have been tasked by our Creator God to take care of the Earth. As for war, I do believe there are legitimate reasons to fight, but I don't know if I have seen one since Hitler tried to take over the world and eradicate races. I am not for the American dream, but see it as a tool of Satan. God is first above family and money. However, I have been entrusted with many blessings and am called by God to be a good steward of them. See Ephesians 5. Women and men do have different roles. This doesn't mean they are to be confined to the house barefoot and pregnant. They are man's counterpart and helper. As Genesis states, He made both of them in His image. Just as Christ is God and equal to God. So is woman to man. Jesus submitted to God and His will. The wife is to do likewise. This doesn't mean I dictate everything, but rather we are to work together and if there is a disagreement with our direction, I am to seek council from the Lord in prayer. He works hearts and can change even the man's heart to understand the woman. 
I could go on and on. All of this to say I'm glad I'm like neither the writer or the subject. My problem with the liberal Christian worldview is that it fails to live up to the mandate given to us by Christ in Acts 1:8. It's all about a political view. As for the right wingers, they also have bastardized the Gospel with their worldview. Both fail to love their neighbor.

Like how expensive? 
The problem I have with it is that it's not going to change what the organization says its name is. We could use this same approach anywhere, but he'd be better off writing a piece about how this offends a people group with quotes from said people. The Washington Bullets changed to the Wizards, so anything is possible. However, I'm sure they'd lose a ton of money and fans. I wonder what they could change it to. 
Wow! 
Makes me think of how they wouldn't say Voldemort's name in Harry Potter.
Not sure if they have it here. 
I see what you're saying. I just don't think it's going to be a catalyst. 
I'll have to check it out. 
In this case, I'm sensing a one and done. 
If they did, I could envision the NFL pulling their weight to make them sorry for trying. This isn't just a Washington issue. It's also an NFL issue.

Yeah, I think I am done too. I have one more load of laundry to swap out though. 
9343

I am all swapped and in bed now! 
I miss you so much!

Tomorrow night we can fix that! 
I think I need to say goodnight now sweetie. I love you so much! I can't wait to be next to you tomorrow!

Good morning beautiful! How did you sleep? 
9343

9343

I know! I thought I had saved it but apparently not! 
I was out too. I had to be in a little early so I am a little sleepy too! 
9343

9343

It would be tough to squeeze it in today. You also caught me on a casual day! 
9343

That's good. I hate it when I get stuck. He and I will be out next week.

New Hampshire and Maine. 
Sorry! Crazy morning being at the store first and then stuck in meetings. 
If mike can come over either night that would be great! 
Hahaha! I'll be more careful this time! 
9343

We are leaving on Sunday. 
Yes
Morning sunshine ;)
How are things beautiful? 
Yeah here too :(
That is just nuts! Anything fun on the photography side? 
I have never been a fan of photographing people! 
Did he pronounce it correctly? ;)
Cool! 
Me too! I am really looking forward to it. 
Thanks. 
You sent me one the other night that was very pretty. I usually do sunrises ;)
Yes! 
That would be a blast! 
9343

I sure wish I was headed that direction for vacation! 
Starting to storm here!

We actually lost power for a few seconds! 
9343

Hopefully it will stop before you have to leave! Where is the party tonight? 
That's right. You told me that before. 
Hahaha perfect! 
9343

Looking cute as ever! 
Yay! I am glad everyone is ok! 
9343

9343

Ok. Did you want to be there too or should I just have him come whenever? 
Ok sweetie. I wasn't sure how long you were planning on staying at the retirement. 
Are you sure that is the right number? 
That makes it nice! 
Hahaha that's ok! 
Apparently no one else has it yet so they were just getting rejected! 
I am home now so whenever is best for you. 
Do you need directions or did Val already tell you how to get here? 
Ok. 1113 St Andrews Ct Akron 44312 
Ok. I'll be here. 
Mike is going to come now. Well sort of. He has to stop at home first and get gas. 
Hahaha! I am beginning to wonder if I will get to see you tonight! ;)
Me too baby! 
Just got home. I am so sleepy tonight! 
That would feel wonderful! 
And I bet whatever came after would feel even better! 
All done with mike! 
Yeah it went fine. 
Should I head your way? 
I would be happy to come to you since I am all done. 
Ok! I might have to stop for gas but we will see! 
Ok. I am on my way. I think I am going to need to stop. 
Ok! 
9343

I miss you already! 
I like it much better when I am there too! 
I know just what you mean! I can't wait for vacation to start!

I have no idea. You'll have to show me what you are doing. 
You make me happier then I ever knew I could be! 
No. Once you add it to the library you should be able to put it into a playlist 
Its so lonely here without you. 
I miss you so much! 
I don't like it either sweetie. It is so much nicer having you next to me!

Definitely!

I am so sleepy! I hope this morning goes quickly!

It should be quiet. Just one more meeting and 1 call!

Oh no sweetie! Is it bad? 
Maybe they will disband while you are out!

That doesn't sound good! 
Is this the one that was at 4:30?
I am done! 
9343

How is your afternoon sweetie? 
Yay! I am officially on vacation! 
Don't I wish! 
Yes! I am trying to start cleaning but I keep finding ways to get distracted! 
Just got home. I need to get a jump on cleaning and laundry. You? 
Hahaha. Ooops. We are headed to new Hampshire and Maine. 
Nope. We always try to go somewhere new.

Did you escape yet sweetie?

Yay! I just finished scrubbing the carpet potatoes. Then Hobo peed on it. 
Hahaha! They are a lot like pet frogs! 
Although I suppose my carpet is probably dirty enough to grow potatoes! 
I'll be out of town on vacation. You are being bs'd.
Hahaha! 
I would hate to make them sad.

I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning so playing in the fall softball league may be difficult. 

I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning. It should be roughly a thirty day job but can always turn into more or less. I will know more next week, but I wanted to let you know asap so you can make the right decision for the team to maybe move me back to a substitute. The job could end before the season starts but like I said I'll know a little more next week. 
Back to Lafayette for work come Monday. It should be more profitable this time, lol.

@PopeSnogginheim that's all I've been saying, too. Don't be a coward about it. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries we've indoctrinated western culture? Because I think most cultures are male dominated and sorely overlooked the importance of respecting women in general. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries Black American culture has indoctrinated western civilization's culture? It seems most cultures, globally, are male dominated and most have sorely overlooked and downplayed the importance of respecting women and how important women are to any society in general. 
To go further; it seems this lack of respect/recognition of importance, is more damaging to black women. Stereotypically, black women already have such a damaged reputation (which I don't subscribe to personally), depsite the fact this idea of black women being relegated to baby mama's, gold diggers, and women of promiscuity aren't true in the majority of cases. 
I think the truth -like with most stereotypes- is that a small percentage of women validate a false overarching stereotype that imprison the majority of women who aren't really like that. 
Am I wrong for viewing it this way? I am not a woman (no surprise), so I don't know what women go through, but I would like a better understanding. 
I think all people under the boot of malicious stereotypes and damaging reputations seem to put this faux sense of responsibility and intense pressure on themselves to fix or change a problem that most likely isn't theirs to begin with...

I thought Vick said he forgave Cooper and that LeSean McCoy said that it was too big. I could be wrong. 

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--michael-vick-helping-to-clean-up-riley-cooper-s-mess-193236048.html 

To change direction... It's strange how some of the same people who generally never forgave Vick for what he did, are now rushing to decide what is and isn't forgivable for others coupled with how quickly they should move on. But the N-word is the double standard they want to focus on?
How overt is enough?

A lifetime ban is excessive, because I do believe people have the capacity to change.... but since we are focusing this on Vick's story; anyone care to talk about the hypocrisy of never forgiving Vick, but demanding people get over this and forgive Cooper because he apologized? Vick apologized to and did his time.

That said at least Cooper's apology seemed genuine and he wasn't looking to blame the usual suspects (pun intended) for his own doing.

[quote="Gonzo"]Warren Sapp was a one-of-a-kind defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his bust in Canton will be the first of its kind.

Sapp could have been bald on his bust. He had that look for most of his years in Tampa Bay, actually, and had a shaved head for his biggest moment, when the Buccaneers won a Super Bowl. He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe?

What more is he supposed to do? And what does him being an ex-con have to do with him being offended. I guess he loses that right from now huh?

He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe? Maybe not... Are there any busts in Canton with bad hairstyles from the 80's and 90's? Like Mullets or high rights- low lefts aka gumby, or rat tails?

Felony? Is that based on previous arrests or is cause his cigarrettes had a felonious amount in each?

To George Serapis well of course. They're just getting a taste of an everyday struggle for others, but they're going to be pissed because discussions on race are going to be more and more prevalent...
What other white billionaire can you look at and say the same? And I mean with out knowing who they are, what they own, or what they're driving? Like Tom Ford or Armani suits have big ass logos... Cmon now. 
Well I definitely agree with that. The more appropriate term is implicit bias. We all have those. 
I don't disagree with any of that really... And I don't really know fashion like that either. 

I agree that it's true, we all have implicit biases... I'm just saying - it's one thing to be uncertain what a billionire looks like when they come in to your store to shop. It's another to be certain of who isn't a billionaire based on what they look like and treat them a certain way because of it. It is a mixture of both classism and racism because the assumed limit and treatment based on the assumed limit.

In her defense, she campaigned hard to be the monkey in Choke.
@KristiNoem PRISM. Irony.
And Marie Mathews is 16 years old and a Conneticut teenager at Archie Andrews High School. She's editor of the school paper and has a shot to graduate early, with an academic scholarship. Which bugs her. 
Why? The first semester is almost over, and she's doing very well. This is the first year being head of the class is possible. It nags at her though, because her old friend and neighbor Angel Glover used to be first in their class. 
Angel had been the top student, but then over the summer his Dad was in an incident with a mugger and was shot dead. Angel apparently hasn't been dealing with it very well; he shows up late to class constantly, and he wears heavy sweaters constantly to apparently cover bruises. Rumors persist that he's getting into drugs or gangs; harsher rumors sat he's prostituting himself. 
And isn't one to believe rumors though, and tries reaching out to her friend. She's also a little curious where they stand, because they made out a little at a Fourth of July harvests, before his Dad died. Angel is very curt though, brushing her off. 
The scholarship Ann wants typically goes to whoever wins the Science Award at the end of the year. She has competition from Angel, as well as Irene, who is much more ruthless than either. Items would rather not have her competition be a factor anymore.

Bataya na CAP se door ki college me hua. Toh 
The keyboard is definitely snappier, and the new settings are amazing. (whenever I try to intentionally miss the space, and enter a new word, it doesn't work, but that isn't a feature that was absolutely necessary... So, awesome work guys! )
One suggestion. Most of the time, I don't really miss the space, but the keyboard registers it as a few separate letters. 

Like, 

"Fleksy is awesome! " 

Becomes 

Fleksy isgjaersome 

Between is and awesome, the keyboard registered the letters gj, or gh, or hj. 

Would it be possible for the keyboard to recognise when this happens, and change "isgjawesome" to "is awesome" 

It would be a really neat feature, what do you think guys?

     Everyone was pointing out at something in the distance, with terrified faces. Aditya got up from his seat, made his way through the crowd, while maintaining his balance in the shaky local train. Local trains in India, are quite different, compared to other countries. The biggest difference being that their doors are always open, whether the train is stationary, or moving. And the trains shook a lot. Enough to make a person unable to maintain balance without holding on to something.
And yes, we are being unable to contact rahima, (we are getting the message 'the number you have dialed is not in service'). Please give us the correct contact number.

I miss you too 
Haha should be fun. Plus we can hang out with Kinkade. 
I think 1025 but I'm not sure. Can you ask them how nothing is owed? That makes no sense. 
Yeah sounds good 
I just paid the 15 yesterday. So did you pay the 1000+ on mine or are we going to wait until it says we owe? 
Alrighty 
Thanks babe. 
Its 125 to fix the tv 
Hey dad we found a 42 inch plasma tv. It has no base so it would probably have to be mounted. Its 125 to fix the green color of the screen. Other than that it's a nice tv. Not sure if it's worth it and we probably can't put it up anywhere until we move what do you think? 
Yeah we got a free estimate from a tv repair place
Checked 4 other places and they charged 40-50 for an estimate 
Yeah found next to dumpster. 
Okay. Its pretty heavy for being so flat. I think it will be nice mounted though
He offered to store it in the attic. So maybe. 
Don't think it would fit in our room anywhere do you? 
Just found an hour long youtube video of that remix to sail. GG

Works great on the Asus transformer prime. It runs very smooth and the features are awesome. I love having the ability could set your own wallpaper though, instead of just having the default ones.  Edit: I also tested it out on my Nexus 4 and liked it as well. The more I use it the more I like it. There is room for improvement though. Just one example is that when you switch from landscape to portrait mode (or vise versa) the widgets don't flip the way one would expect. Keep up the good work though.

You will come back and be stronger. Don't lose your faith. God will be there for you. Randomly choose verses to read. It will help. Jeremiah is playing football now. He's pretty good. Jeremiah misses his sister too. I will forward my verses of the day that I think may encourage you. Love you.

I am so thankful to have Scherry in my life. She loves and supports me more than I deserve. 
You are not alone.. This past week has been a horrible one. I thought I could help by making Theresa act right
Then I find out she can only help herself and is just using me. I hurt you do bad and I don't mean too 
I am only nice because you've taught me about caring more for others than myself. I don't even argue with people anymore. 
At GFF Jeremiah said he wished you had taken him because I was mean because I told him not to hit my back
You are the nicest, sweetest person I've ever known 
I am not. I try in my heart to treat you the best way, but I continue to make the worst decisions and hurt you. I am so sorry
I love you so much. I want you to feel the way you make me feel inside. You make me feel loved, wanted and needed
My only fear is to let you down
cherrywithns@gmail.com
I've never done things for you because I was afraid. I have always thought of you as my partner and have tried to make you proud of me
I used to be totally self centered and cared only about what I wanted but your love and kindness has shown me a better way and my life is better for it
You deserve better than me. You are a queen, an angel, a great and loving person who doesn't deserve any pain. 
I try so hard to help Jeremiah be a good and loving person so he won't make the mistakes I've made

Oh... Not good. You couldn't just open up the case and fix it? 
Stupid warranty rules. Yeah I would have too... 
Well I'm just a bit biased in that... But I'd say android. Though I'm presuming you'd jailbreak on iPhone? 
As far as music goes on android Google play music has come a long way. And its super easy to switch from itunes. As far as cases and stuff it really depends on the phone. Mine is kinda hard to find stuff for but some like the samsung galaxys have almost as much as iphones. I will say this for iphones though. Group messaging and customer service. 
ff52d924175ef8faf90649927af87ca.flv
Some people have had success with it using apps to replace the stock messaging and on a few phones it works most of the time natively but on mine its pretty much a disaster. You might ask Demian how his works. Think of Google play like itunes. There's Google play music Google play store Google play books etc. Yeah or from the phone. I can stream my music or add remove apps from my phone on any computer with Internet. Just sign on to Google and its all there. 
Haha yeah there's a small problem. Once again I'm biased but I would say wait until the nexus 5 (the next version of mine) or whatever it's called is released and then decide. Historically that'll be this fall or early winter. The nexus line is nice because we get updates straight from Google instead of waiting months for oems to modify them. And prices for an unlocked no contract phone are much better. Also it depends on whether you like the skins that the manufacturers put on the phones. Though you could also put a custom rom on that'll do the same thing 
Oh and if you do decide to do a lot a customizing with it in the way of roms you can't mess a nexus up too bad unlike other phones. 
Haha sorry. Oems are original equipment manufacturers like samsung htc Motorola etc. Kinda. But not like I wanna run android 4.0 instead of 4.3. Its more like they add additional options that stock android or the skins don't have.

Ok won't bother u anymore. 
Yeah it was probably a pinched nerve, that shit will Fuck u up
Yeah but your sisters may have the wrong type of life insurance. Let me call them, if it ain't broke I won't fix it. But what if their policy don't work the way they think it does or if I can give them more coverage for the same price or the same coverage for cheaper. U never know I've seen so many horror stories, there are alot of fucked up insurance companies out there. 
What's good man how u been?
We also do investments too, so they may be interested in that

U right about that! 
What's up my boy, everything all good with u?
Don't know bro, I'm pretty much done with that illegal shit. 
LOL u will wear it or shit will get physical, u ain't bout that life! LOL 
That's a possibility. I got my kids now till maybe around that time. My mom may get them though. Let me know when u get off. 
But I'll holler at u, I still do know alot of people in my biz that burn that good. So maybe I can hook u up but I ain't dealing. My past ways got me where I'm at so I'm trying to stay disciplined in my new lane.

I know, that shit can be rough trust me I know. I have other challenges besides my kids and sometimes I feel like jumping off a bridge! LOL but just focus on the good because whatever u focus on grows whether it's negative or positive! 
If u ever need someone to talk to to cheer u up, I'm always here any time! 
It'll take some time but once u emotionally detach yourself from them and they know they ain't got you by the balls (so to speak), that basically they can't affect you anymore. All of a sudden shit magically changes. Either way it's a win win for u! And we've been split about 10 months. 
Yeah in due time... Yep she is
Like immediately after we split too, she is the type that has to be with someone to feel good about herself
At that point I didn't give a Fuck, its weird I'd have to explain it. U wanna talk?

It'll be like three four years after Rises that this is gonna come out so technically it's not that short of a time gap. My only thing was I thought that since Nolan produced it, they could bring Bale back and make it fit into the original trilogy as an intermediary plot (like Lion King 1 1/2 lol) but I guess not.

I have noticed every now and then when pressing the back haptic key it seems to get held up, less responsive. Noticed more so in the messaging app.

Knowing is half the battle. 

But something I've learned about android is there is no identical device. Each have a mind of its own. 

Is there something else I can do to give you more details?

Other simple details about my device is that I did a clean install coming from Eclipse TW latest build. Wiped data, cache, dalvik.

That's the only bit I want. 
I was just wondering if it would still bake the same or if the apples baking with it somehow make it taste better. 
Yeah but does it change the crumble part in any way? I guess I'll just have to try it.

Best Clearomizers? 
I'm relatively new to vaping and am really enjoying it so far; I have an Ego C with a Viva Nova tank. 

I would like to get another clearomizer and was wondering what the consensus is on the best brand, size and resistance. Any other recommendations and insights are of course welcomed!

This is very nice indeed! I really like the Fleksy keyboard but unfortunately it doesn't support the German language. 
max

@fleksy This keyboard experience is amazing! Adding German is on 6th spot in your requests. How fast do you think this could be added?

@trade605 indeed. I really have no idea why it does that. Super annoying. 
@Teslief @insanj exactly. Worked fine on 6.0 but after upgrading to 6.1.2 they won't save.. Haven't found a way to fix this. 
So it's around 2pm. Hope that damn tweet about my battery won't pop up again. :/

Hey, 

Sorry to do this again but a two days notice is not enough time. I'm moving to manhole Saturday. We have a uhaul scheduled and I cannot change that. On top of that, Jesse is my moving buddy so we are both busy Saturday. 

I had a 4 am issue at GCSO to deal with last night and it kept me up till about 6 or so. I will stop by to discuss when I get in today. 

Thanks,

That is true. I don't believe we are needed at all. Part of what I was gonna discuss with them. 

Just pissed me off that they try to include or ask us for something like that with a two day notice. Not is it ok?? But we are doing this... Just pissed me off.

Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th. 
Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th, then have a cookout at our house on the 17th. This would give Masato a day to relax at home before flying to Tampa on the 18th in the morning. Additionally, Friday the 16th is "foodie friday" and all the food vendors have an item for 50% off that day. Can you come on the 16th? Alternatively, you can wander up for the cookout on the 17th? 
I will check the weather on Monday and decide with Masato. Of the 16th and 17th, one day will be a hangout day at our house and a cookout, and one will be a state fair day. Do you prefer one or the other?

Mehregan Apple Pie

8 large apples peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tbsp  lemon juice
2 tbsp  white sugar
1/3 cup  maple syrup
1/4 cup  brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp  cinnamon
1/2 tsp  ground ginger
1 1/2 tbsp  cornstarch
1/4 tsp  salt
milk

Persian ingredients:
dash of saffron
1 1/2 tsp cardamom
crushed pistachios


=== CRUST ===

1. Roll one batch of the pie pastry into a 13-inch circle and line a 9 1/2 inch
pie pan with it, letting the excess dough drape over the edge. Refrigerate the
pie shell while making the filling.


=== FILLING ===

1. Combine the apples, 3 tbsp of white sugar, and lemon juice. Mix well, then
set aside for 10 minutes to juice.

2. After 10 minutes, mix the remaining maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon,
ground ginger, cornstarch, and salt with the apples. Mix well.

To make it Persian, add a dash of saffron in step 1, and cardamom in an equal
amount to cinnamon in step 2.


=== BAKING ===

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Roll the remaining chilled pastry into an 11 inch
circle. Scrape the filling into the bottom pie shell and smooth with a spoon.

2. Lightly moisten the rim of the pie shell. Place the rolled dough over the top
of the filling and press the top and bottom shells together at the edge.

3. Trim the dough flush with the edge of the pan. Press on the rim with the
tines of a fork to make a crimped edge. With the fork, poke the top of the pie
crust several times to make steam vents. Brush the top of the pie lightly with
milk (for glaze) and sprinkle with sugar.

To make it Persian, sprinkle crushed pistachios on top.

4. Bake on the center oven rack for 30 minutes at 400F. Reduce the heat to 375F
and rotate the pie 180 degrees. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes more, until any
visible juices bubble thickly. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool at least
2 hours before serving.

COMMENT BY USER eatmedetroit:
I have used this recipe twice-excellent. Read carefully, I have been to
23 countries. This is how I modified: No meat--too greasy. No garlic--not needed.
No sugar--use aged vinegar, nice and sweet. I also added one cube chicken
boullion and one can of chicken stock, no fat. Also HALF the tomato paste.
FRESH dill--lots. Cooked onions in grape seed oil, high burn rate. If you follow
what I suggest, you will achive culinary greatness and Ukrainian authenticity.

brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

I don't follow. Alternative medicine is already a huge market, probably because it already is not prescription. Anyone is free to buy alternative medicine from whoever produces it. 

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition.

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition. You'd go to the doctor to get diagnosed, and the doctor would tell you what drugs to get. It's no different than going to a mechanic to get your car problems diagnosed. But you don't need a prescription to get parts for your car. And most people have a mechanic they trust, just like they have a doctor they trust. 
You're already getting commercials for snake-oil erectile dysfunction "medicine" (which is not FDA-approved and often not even safe). So what harm would it be to have commercials for real erection dysfunction drugs that actually work and aren't tainted with lead?

How many impoverished immigrant parents are horribly educated, can barely speak English, but invest a huge amount of time and effort making sure their kids grow up with better opportunities than they did? A lot. 

The first thing someone notices about you is your appearance--how you dress, your mannerisms, how you carry yourself. The second thing they notice is what comes out as soon as you open your mouth.

If you screw either one of those things up from the beginning, people aren't going to take you seriously; they're going to make a conclusion about who you are by those first moments. 

First impressions are important. How you speak is part of it. 
I've never seen an outhouse in Tennessee, but I have seen bathrooms of such poor quality and sanitation at rural gas stations that I'd have rather used an outhouse or a port-o-potty. 

By the way, I believe the majority of Alaskans actually do use outhouses.

Ah. There'd very little the kid can do. I thought you were suggesting that it's not unreasonable that impoverished, uneducated parents can't raise a child out of the poverty cycle because they, themselves, were raised poorly. 

If you're a kid born to crap parents, there's not much you can do other than just to do your best. But if you have kids of your own, there's no reason that they have to be raised in the same way.

I think police would find that of they acted with reasonable force 
If more cops acted this way, people would trust them more. If people trusted them more, they'd also cooperate more. If people trusted and cooperated with police, the police would have much less reason to feel threatened by the public, and they'd probably find that their job even becomes safer.

Arab countries have done this numerous times before in Israel's short history, and Israel has come out on top every time. Israel has an extremely competent and strong military, and it is precisely because of this strength that the United States even started to ally with them as a Middle-Eastern counter to the Soviet Union. Israel is, today, militarily stronger than ever before in history. The Arab nations will not go to war for Palestine, *again*, because they will not win that war, *again*. And if they use terrorism as a way to perpetually harass the Israeli population, they'll find themselves on the receiving end of Israeli air strikes. 
Nuclear weapons are almost strategically worthless. Israel will not use nuclear weapons. Neither will Iran, for that matter.

Palestine is as much of a mess, with basically several governments and a complete refusal to accept Israel's existence. Not only does Israel exist, it exists so much that it's occupied you for decades and can basically unilaterally decide your fate! It also refuses to renounce violence, even though Palestinian terror is the primary excuse Israel uses to justify its actions, and even though a pacifist Palestine would undeniably be on the moral high ground, almost assuring better international support.

On top of all of this, both sides seem to most agree on a two state solution, but that's a mess, too. How can you live in such a small area with so many locked-down borders? How can business get done? And Palestine is so incredibly small, how can it succeed as a country? The Gaza Strip is smaller than most sponsors in America, and the West Bank is smaller than even a moderately-sized American metro area.

Lance, 

Perhaps I may have missed something, but I don't exactly know what a Lessons Learned template is. Where would I find it?

Katie, 

Ostensibly, the HAIMS deployment at Lackland is supposed to start in a little over a month. I have not received invites to any PIM calls. Does this mean that the training dates might be getting pushed? 

Also, has there been any word, yet, on the rescheduling of Dover or Edwards? 

Thanks, 

Tom

The culture of the conference - I felt incredibly at home there with such a focus in this subculture . Schedule was great and manageable -- never felt like I was struggling through the sessions. The choice of speakers were great. Main sessions were total winners as well, really hitting on areas I encounter. There really seemed to be a consistent theme of the battle of the mind. Conference staff and servants were amazing -- really felt like I was apart of the experience with them instead of just being an observer. Having Pastor Matt Chandler was a perfect session to end the conference.

Hey really quick. We are having our equip and inspire conference from August 13th to 15th. You should come! And anyone else in your church that is interested. Its a personal and ministry development conference. Also, I'm working with Studio Red to develop one of our breakouts which is focused on visual story telling through film.. And all of life. If you or anyone else is interested... Let me know!

Hey Uncle Doug. Welcome back! A few questions : 

Could we get the keys for the garage door and the back door? 

We noticed there's a grill in the front yard. Are you guys planning to take that up? 

The fan in Marisa's former room is wobbling at certain speeds. Are we allowed to attempt to balance it? 

And finally, is there anything we can arrange and help you guys out with your move? At your new house and here? 
Got it. No keys necessary in that case. I'll ask the guys if they each want individual alarm and door codes. 

Cool, I'll take a look at the fan. 

I'll check with the others about the yard. I'll let you know if anyone is up for it. I'll gladly help out. When were you thinking?

Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago.

Don't be mistaken into thinking someone who agrees to this situation immediately is the wrong choice.

If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society.
Where are you
Come to the coats
Downstairs before the main room to pray in
Hahah
Come down 
Go in and turn left 
I know I'm just yep

Come down then

Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous.
Haha okay
Kay
Is this chando
Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Afif Mulla <afifmulla@gmail.com>, 
Most of us have been in a situation where they have found themselves wanting more with a friend, physically of course. For me it was my best friend which morphed nicely into a full blown relationship. 


Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago. Industries like porn are booming, sex toys are slowly becoming something of a normal shopping experience. Sex is no longer a taboo subject area. 


So with all that taken into consideration its becoming a lot easier for friends to become friends that fuck. But does it last? Is it really that easy and emotionless? Or will someone end up getting hurt? 


How to get into that situation? 


Well unlike a relationship there is no commitment, you think just sex would be appealing to anyone, you're wrong. Some people know they are full of emotion and therefore it wouldn't work for them. Others feel that they could do it, but they probably will get attached and finally they are well up for it. 


Don't be mistaken into thinking someone who agrees to this situation immediately is the wrong choice. After all, they only want what you want emotionless sex. 


Unlike relationships asking someone shouldn't be a task, it shouldn't feel like a big deal, you'd be choosing a friend you wanted to have sex with already and if the situation is female to male I bet most males would jump at the chance. 


Is it 'slaggy'? 


Well of course you're a whore male or female, after all, you want your friend plowing you or allowing you to plow them, over no stronger attraction than just friends. 


If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society. 


Will this stay as sex for both parties? 


Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Hi Aunty Angela, 
Hi Aunty Angela, how are you today? It was so much great fun being with you on both Wednesday and Thursday nights! Thanks heaps again for the DVD stand! I love it, I even attached a photo of it with my DVDs in to show you! In regards to the movie we're going to see, Mum says we can go to the one at 12:15 tomorrow if you like? 
Yep! Cool! Mum says that's fine. I'm looking forward to tomorrow already! Thanks, glad you like how I got it set up! The bottom two rows are just CD box sets that I thought would look great there!

The second one wasn't about a fat guy but yes same idea. 
Indeed. What I was talking about comes more into play when someone wants to lose "trouble fat" aka that last sliver of fat that makes your abs stay concealed. 

Obviously people with an obesity problem need to straight up cut calories. I'm just saying other factors influence how quickly you can lose weight especially if you're body is well maintained. 
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, 
Should I overclock in a m-itx build (such as the Prodigy)? Because it seems like everything would overheat in such a small and confined space, but maybe I'm wrong (probably). Also, even if I don't overclock should I get the 4670k over the 4670 due to it being better or something? Or just go with the 4670? Also,c what's the best m-itx board for the 4670? One more question I have is, if I do overclock a 4670k in a m-itx build, should I use a closed loop cooler such as the H50 or will an aftermarket heatsink be enough? Thanks guys.
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, if you want a CLC, you might as well go for a bigger one like an h100i or else air coolers will work equally well for less noise. The Phanteks tc-12dx is a great cpu cooler. 
White cases are sexy. We need more good monitors in white to match them. 
If someone isn't saving money, they could still get a z87 with a locked processor for the extra features.

Par for the course with Google though. 
I also believe Xperia ZR uses that SoC as well. 
I don't want bigger batteries as much as I want good battery life. Unlike a lot of people here, a compact and thin phone is in fact desirable in my eyes. I won't buy a phone thicker than 10mm and bigger batteries also means longer charge times. 

Technically, we need new battery tech that has greater energy density. 

Also, battery life is like the one thing moto does well with its phones. 
Sounds like the moto x. I feel like they really missed the mark on price. 
A shitty one at that. 
I bought a 120GB ipod and threw my entire music collection on it. Then I realized I got skip syndrome because of that. Returned it and got an 8GB Sandisk and an mSD card and reorganized songs into playlists. Life is better now. 

Personally I just want 32GB on my phone. 





What is this nonsense? How am I supposed so how what is going on? 
Yikes. 
I still do. 
I still do. It is only on Monday. 
Really. I mean I would probably have to get to your house by five thirty but still

That and wouldn't those with said rifles be more likely to an apocalypse

No, I got the screw on top. I actually found it at TJ Maxx. Works perfectly fine for me. Its pretty sturdy. The green plastic is thick and hard, but it feels like the brittle type. It'd take a lot to break it, but I don't think breaking the handle would be out of the question of you dropped it from a fair height onto solid concrete. Its not Nalgene sturdy, but I can't imagine breaking it in any kind of ordinary way. 

Also, sometimes water can get in between the wood and the glass. There are air holes in the plastic on the bottom of the bottle to mitigate this, but if you get the wood soaking wet, you'll just have to take the pieces apart and let them dry individually.

Frankly, if they used rubberized plastics and rubber instead of the hard plastic and bamboo, this thing would be indestructible and totally awesome. That's probably go against their "green" bottle mantra, though.

That was from memory. And I started playing BioShock less than two weeks ago. I just really love that speech. 


Also, as someone who has obviously played the first BioShock, if I just reached Heapheastos, how long do I have until I reach the end? Please don't spoil anything, I already know too much.

Dentist 

Tooth care 

Do you guys think this is a cavity?

Hello, 
A few questions about my teeth. 
Hello, I am here to ask a few questions about my teeth. 


First of all, some background. I am a thirteen year old male who has had braces. I still have wires behind some of my teeth in the front. I generally do a good at brushing my teeth, and have started flossing nightly after my last visit to the dentist. I have never had a cavity. 


Alright, time for some questions. 


Does [this] (http://imgur.com/H5Jc6PN) appear to be a cavity? I would find this very odd for I do not eat sweets and have always done a pretty good job at keeping my teeth clean. I also saw the dentist less than a week ago and she said that screening looked good, but I should floss to make sure my gums stay healthy. 


If it were to be a cavity, how would I go about getting rid of it? I really don't want to to have it drilled and filled, for it is only a tiny brown spot on the tooth. 


Are there natural ways to get rid of cavities? I ask because I have seen many articles about this. 


If the picture I have supplied does not give a good enough view, I can try to get a better one. 


Thank you for any answers you give.

Would you eat the bark or rub it on the tooth? I've also heard that cod liver oil can completely fix cavities. Have you heard anything about that? Do you think it could fix tooth decay too?

If you are planning on gaming, you will want a graphics card. If you can raise your budget to $1000, you can add a GTX 760. This is one of the best price to performance cards. You can run Crysis 3 on high/max with this card. 


TL;DR: If you don't get a graphics card, this will run nothing but minesweeper and Half Life 1.

I think love feels like those times when you wanted to give up but then you can't allow yourself to do so. Like ugh you want to give up soooo bad because you know that you would be better without but no some how you're still there. Like those movies where in the scene the character is reaching out to something that he can almost grasp but not quite like its almost there but no. 

Whichever is cheaper for you. Either refund or sending another would be fine with me. 
Actually I would prefer a refund.

Yeah but my comments may have been a little different if I'd known ;) I'm happy to be mostly positive. I think it's a good step forward with it. That's true a good offline task can be handy. Looks a good list tbh and I hope your flight goes well. 

A 1.5 option if you like :D 

Haha yeah one or two purchases then :P
Hey Karen, dad says you don't want fajitas on Monday. That's cool, 
Hey Karen, dad says you don't want fajitas on Monday. That's cool, Nats will just get stuff for mum and dad plus her. You still want to do the BBQ? We have sausage but if you could get the burgers, barms and finger rolls. We'll get the BBQ this weekend I think. See you on Monday 
Yeah that's OK. Thought you would get it there. Yes we realise that but it will be ok in a cool box, don't think it will be that hot. 
Hey Richard. How are you doing? Just noticed you're at Patton Air. Went for an interview there earlier this year. If anything comes up I'd be interested at getting another crack at an interview. Just so you know I'm CIPS qualified now. 

Hope things are going well for you.

Hey no problem. Yeah that sounds like a good plan. You can always put 'to be spent on Denby only'

I gots it! There is a much easier way than giving us the password though haha. I am currently making my way across your home state on the way to mine. Why is it so big? And then at the end is Ohio. Ohio is awful.

stopped for food
Well that's true but I mean, Staten Island has Dairy Queen. Or is getting one. But it's probably just as easy to go to Ohio. 
Ahahaha
Not as big as it looks. It was delicious but like a Sarges sandwich is WAY more food

I had a vision while drinking, you should check that pocket 
Oh, don't sweat it. It was a whim that passed pretty quick, washing my bedding like a human :)
Did you check it? 
Different meds
You should watch the bridge, it features my new tv crush (guess I'm already over jons brother)
Worth checking... 
You? 
It was a fun birthday, at no point was I overwhelmed with people, and nobody stuck around long enough to hate me :)
Wanna hang, got some wash to finish

Without space to toss and 
Without space to toss and turn, I go strait to sleep :)
I only saw one gecko when I was+there, lots of anoles though
I assume the wildlife is regional, and they'd have a lot of competition for food, so it wouldn't shock me. The anoles you can wear as earings, because they'll clamp down and not let go :)
Cuz the weather is hell?

When's your party? I'll probably be late, but I'll get the us there early 
Pa
Ok, I was gonna mention the show was moved to super late, but I'm still into happy hour. I'll focus on being extra drakee tomarrow
Till be there? 
I don't mind either of those things :)
I'm going to be there, I've been working nights :(
My beard is at ultimate gross stage, cuz I'm growing it (though I suppose you saw that Saturday), also, haven't drank some Sunday, yay
You? 
Cuz they don't know you failed at shower :)
Also, pops is playing at the riverfront tonight, a female friend will probably be there
No, shirly
Weren't you all I want to have female friends I envy you? She's about as single as I am
Sara? 
I couldn't handle that
My lie about mere poking
I'll Prolly be lingering in the area all evening
Oh, yeah, that's how I'd do it... 
Yep, on the river
Pretty sure one getting oysters, then I'll probably linger to iron hill
Sarahs doing happy hour, but gonna cut out early, I think Scali said fuck ten o'clock, Jon may be coming out
Anyway, you can try your magic of you want. I am pretty sure she gives everyone a date no matter what, I can't determine how she decides who to date again and fuck 
Yeah, me too, I'm Prolly getting drunk in the parking lot
Now she's hedging on coming out
You coming out tonight? 
Ok, whatever you feel like
Yes, thanks. 
Are you bringing people? Pops wants people if you know any, the late night fucked them 
Huh ?
It's so late :)
Hah, the combinations are super popular too
He plays at ten, I'm doing happy hour, but then wandering for ahwhile

Are you here still? 
Yeag
That's what female friends are... 
I'm home safe, let me know when yi

I'm home safe, let me know when you are lady. Thanks so much for coming out, hope you had fun
I will
You too 
Sweet dreams when the time comes, and good times until 
Ps, tell James he's a Cunt for not coming 
Even with a crooked face? 
So she's said to me
I'm so drunk, hope this drawing works
I'm home, she's at her boys, and she already said you liked her
Also said a 60 percent chance she shows on Saturday separate from me, but she won't bump Molly so... 
Huh? 
She said you smell bad, I assume you're out
Shirley griffens I think
Thinks what? 
Fucking pink shirt didn't believe we weren't when Shirley was trying to wing man it for me
She was like you have a girlfriend here, I was like huh, and she was like that bitch rubbing on me, and I was like in single, she was like oh, that game 
Yeah, that boy was a frined apperwnkry 
Like Shirley and I... 
I've never heard of a parent being accused of abuse for spanking unless they were the type to do kindly the time to the point that they were hiding actual abuse under the guise of legit punishment 
You're such a good wing man, and apparently a total cock block
Yeah, it was still funny
I feel great 
Perfect amount of hangover to feel like rebirt
H
He's a good guy
She told me off for saying I was single in front of my girlfriend hahahahaha
But you were literally right there in the conversation. 
No way I could lie like that, I lie through ommission and obfuscation, not to the face
Well it's lunch time it's gotta be close, if it's like happy hour, whatever
Omg, epic awkward couple photo
Marriage :)
They DO NOT like each other
Which zoo? 
Bring your tiger poking stick
They have otters
And an awesome bird
Who did? 
They DO NOT like each other
I didn't get close enough
It must be nice to be a girl, you get to rub on everyone and no one cares
Yeah, such an awesome super power
I face booked you the photo
Did we (I) not look like hell this time for the spark photo? Maybe we'll be in it
No, it's tall and colour full, and we looked each other in the eyes and paced together
Scottlan
I'd murder babies for the super power of welcome rubbing
You know it's true, I have no morals and like to rub... 
Do I win awkward couple bingo? 
Landemberg
Like newark basically
I really like human contact
It's true
Pretty sure, ps, that may mean the bird collection is gone from the zoo
No, they were sitting bored
I don't think people think we don't like each other when they see us

Tuesday
The party tomarry? 
Don't know, Prolly nine or ten, wanna brunch? 
You know I love you, but if anything I encourage or watch bad decisions, I am not one to count on to look after, it goes against everything I believe in
It'd make me sad if you whined about it afterwards. So don't do anything you'll regret if you come please
I don't babysit out of love, not terribleness
That's not true, I hate it at times
I don't feel it's my place to control other people
I get hateful when others try to control me too
Live and fucking let live
You were totally anti that a week ago, but sure
I enjoy BEING a shit show, watching people I care about being one makes me sad
But God forbid they feel the same way and try to stop me. Cause moltent fuckin spite for trying to make me not be one
Nope, not at all. I think you're fantastic in spite of what you say

Shirly is bailing for fear of making terrible decisions, so you may be in...

Heathers house is 1202 painters crossing chadds ford pa 19317, Jaime says you should pick her up and give her a call with ample warning that you're coming, if possible, and assuming you're still in newark
Of course, I mean the cock blocking would be ok if she bones me
But as it is, it just sucks
But as long as you're boning me, I won't gripe if people at bars avoid fucking me

We are, she's like a best of friends
It's frustrating that when we go out I'm cock blocked unintentionally
All of my friends are basically females I don't bone

Where is she? Faiths? 
Reddy was pukin hard, I made a new friend, and apparently I rub the shit out of shirly when I'm drunk
Jons like, I've hung out with you guys twice, and you're pawing at her hard 
No, just the one time I slept there, and that wasn't rubbing, just one long grope
Really? So much playful prancing
Odd
When I slept there, absolutly not
I am not concious of the constant rubbing, so who knows
How's your sister? 
They're still driving from nc, I'm picking her up like 330
Good. You were totally chill about it, but it stressed me
Jon was like are you serious, why do people think you're dating? I really was unawarw
So what do you have against him? 
On Thursday some girl she was trying to wing man for me was like you have a girl friend. I was like no, and she said I was lieing

Now she says, I was refering to her last time. 
Your party was awesome. As Reddy says, the best sausage fest ever
Apparently whenever I'm drunk I strait up rub her constantly without really even noticing
Yeah, you're the one that told. I probably should apologize and not drink as much around her

Haha I wouldn't say it's a big problem. 
You hush! 

Maybe 

Definitely! But I think there are ways around it. Having someone 
live with you makes things a lot easier. But find an apartment that has utilities already paid for. Buy a car outright for like 2,000 so you won't have to make payments. Get straight talk (pay $45 a month). Cable tv is a big no no (just get a fast Internet plan for like $60). So in total, if you figure in the monthly bills, your part would be like $400-500 a month. That's not bad. You

Lol that's true. 

Why are you afraid you won't graduate, you obviously do want to graduate. Some people don't even care about if they graduate, they have no ambition to do bigger and better things with their lives. You want something better with your life, remember you told me you wanted to live comfortably with your future family. You won't be able to do that living off minimum wage with no high school degree. So make that scenario your motivation to get things done! Because if you don't, you know the repercussions. Life is all about working hard and getting what you want, as long as you WANT IT, you'll get it! And if that doesn't motivate you then I'll help you stay on task!!! Haha

Serious question for you. 
Why do I keep dating people younger than me? Is it because I'm immature or because I have a better connection with the younger crowd. 
You know that song is at 1. 7 billion views now? 
Why do I keep finding myself liking younger girls? 
Are you talking sex or life? 
So are you. Don't judge me. Btw I can get you into the museum of science and industry for free. I've been a member since 2007
Hey you. What's going on? 
Why do you say that? 
You made me think of something.

Any rationale as to why or just a personal issue with it. Seems rather odd since this tends to form a cornerstone of most career thinking these days tying personal goals to company goals and direction as well as how to develop yourself in the context of your own personal style and skills. Learning seems to think everyone can be trained into a particular style as opposed to leveraging their personal style.
