Qualifying to be my wife lol. 

Haha I wouldn't say it's a big problem. 
You hush! 

Maybe 

Definitely! But I think there are ways around it. Having someone 
live with you makes things a lot easier. But find an apartment that has utilities already paid for. Buy a car outright for like 2,000 so you won't have to make payments. Get straight talk (pay $45 a month). Cable tv is a big no no (just get a fast Internet plan for like $60). So in total, if you figure in the monthly bills, your part would be like $400-500 a month. That's not bad. You

Lol that's true. 

Why are you afraid you won't graduate, you obviously do want to graduate. Some people don't even care about if they graduate, they have no ambition to do bigger and better things with their lives. You want something better with your life, remember you told me you wanted to live comfortably with your future family. You won't be able to do that living off minimum wage with no high school degree. So make that scenario your motivation to get things done! Because if you don't, you know the repercussions. Life is all about working hard and getting what you want, as long as you WANT IT, you'll get it! And if that doesn't motivate you then I'll help you stay on task!!! Haha

C
Check out this job offer I literally just got 
I seriously wish I could help you. 
Transfer to a school in Chicago. You can come live with me. 
Don't. 
You don't have that much time as it is and you'll become so attached. 
No. I just know you got too big of a heart and I don't want you to stretch yourself way too thin. 
Seriously, slow the fuck down. 
Then go volunteer somewhere. 
I'm anxious to hear back from my new job. 
No clue. I'm still waiting for the official job offer. They had to do a background check. 
I'll pay for it. You can pay me back in kisses. 
But I did the w4 did the i9 and my background check passed at the other job.

Oh trust me, I'm very simple. :p
I always eat out
I'm not a trucker. I'd be dispatch. I put in enough time behind the wheel that I earned that position though. 
I'm not allowed to cook. 
Yeah I'm always right. 
My mom is a control freak so the kitchen is off limits. 
They have literally forbid me from getting a motorcycle and don't want me to move out. 
Not at all. They just want to control me.

Question. 
Could you date someone who's never done anything with a female? 
Lmao

Why not? 
Like never been kissed. 
I've dated a few never been kissed. They are so awkward. 
Really? You wouldn't date someone who's touched a dude? 
Yup totally pure. 
Really what? I'm not talking about me if that's what your asking. 
Would I what? 
Why not? 
Yeah everyone I've ever dated who's never been kissed has that home schooled awkwardness 
Why not? 
You are the only one to say yeah. 
Yeah. Never been on a date either.

Because you're gorgeous. 
I haven't lied to you since I've met you, I'm not going to start now.

Nothing. I'm perfect in every single way. 
Do you own a bicycle? 
Well then we have a few options. We can either take the train or find a way to cram two bikes in my car. 
Don't worry they insult themselves. 
Well I just realized, to get to the train, we'll have to stuff them in my car anyways. I'm a bit slow lol.

Hey you what's going on? 
Watching gundam style for some reason. 
Serious question for you. 
Why do I keep dating people younger than me? Is it because I'm immature or because I have a better connection with the younger crowd. 
You know that song is at 1. 7 billion views now? 
Why do I keep finding myself liking younger girls? 
Are you talking sex or life? 
So are you. Don't judge me. Btw I can get you into the museum of science and industry for free. I've been a member since 2007
Hey you. What's going on? 
Why do you say that? 
You made me think of something.

Any rationale as to why or just a personal issue with it. Seems rather odd since this tends to form a cornerstone of most career thinking these days tying personal goals to company goals and direction as well as how to develop yourself in the context of your own personal style and skills. Learning seems to think everyone can be trained into a particular style as opposed to leveraging their personal style.

S4 doesn't have an spen... S3 is better than iPhone 5. S4 just humiliates it. The iPhone looks nice and its metal. But it scratches easily and you can get dents. The s4 is plastic but it's more likely to survive a fall. The iPhone is super simple. But by being simple it limits what you can do with it. The s4 or really any android phone is YOUR phone. If you want your favourite song as a ringtone... No problem. Want to bluetooth something.. A friend.. Easy want to listen to radio no mathata.. The list goes on and on

I hear ya. I've used both platforms, and rarely run into any problems here on Android. The fragmentation issue continues to get better with 64% of devices running ICS or Jelly Bean, and more often than not, it comes down to the developer coding properly, and not always the version of Android a user is running. I'm a heavy user of Google services, so everything just ties together. I'm sure you feel a similar way in regards to being tied into the Apple ecosystem with iOS and Mac OS X.

The long press for symbols is great, but is there a way to move from one row to the next without having to release, backspace to erase the symbol you didn't want, and then trying a different row? 

For instance, right now I'm not sure whether the @ symbol is on the middle or bottom row - so I longpress middle, and discover that it's not there. At this point I'd ideally like to keep holding down my finger and move it to the bottom row and discover the symbol I want is over there, move my finger to it, and finally release to get just the symbol I wanted.

Those are the only ones I can think of, but if you're worried about time, I can assure you that antutu only takes 10ish minutes. 
I prefer it over skype just because of the free group video calls. But yes, I think I can list 5 design flaws (at least) with hangouts android app off the top of my head. And why in the name of spaghetti doesn't it have a desktop client yet? 
I'm sorry, what is this for? I haven't been able to check messages for about a week and don't know what you're asking me to link... 
Yay! Enjoy! 
I know, but I'm talking about like an entire client like skype has. 
It definitely got to do with something you installed. I'm lazy, so I'd also factory reset just to fix it, but it'll be an issue with whatever you recently updated or installed. 
I'm with you, man. It's so painful to wait... 
Not really, but always make sure it works before you buy it and if you think it does and then it doesn't just demand a refund.

I'm going to vote for the htc one on this one. The camera is beyond phenomenal and its wicked fast. Also, it has a ton of awesome ROMs and nods if you're into rooting. 
Now playing 

I can confirm that it's really light. I can use it for hours on wifi with little drain compared subreddit sync. 
It's in the best release, and the dev is constantly updating it, so I'm expecting it within the next week or so! 
Why do the icons under posts not look embedded anymore? Is it supposed to be like this? It looks kind of funky and I liked it when they looked like a part of the cards.

How does one delete only individual letters on the mini layout without deleting the entire word? I often find myself making typos in words not in my dictionary and would love to just quickly correct them instead of retyping the entire word.

RFID
RFID stands for Radio-Frequency IDentification. The acronym refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying 2,000 bytes of data or less.

How RFID Works

How does RFID work? A Radio-Frequency IDentification system has three parts:

A scanning antenna
A transceiver with a decoder to interpret the data
A transponder - the RFID tag - that has been programmed with information.
The scanning antenna puts out radio-frequency signals in a relatively short range. The RF radiation does two things:
It provides a means of communicating with the transponder (the RFID tag) AND
It provides the RFID tag with the energy to communicate (in the case of passive RFID tags).
This is an absolutely key part of the technology; RFID tags do not need to contain batteries, and can therefore remain usable for very long periods of time (maybe decades).
The scanning antennas can be permanently affixed to a surface; handheld antennas are also available. They can take whatever shape you need; for example, you could build them into a door frame to accept data from persons or objects passing through.

When an RFID tag passes through the field of the scanning antenna, it detects the activation signal from the antenna. That "wakes up" the RFID chip, and it transmits the information on its microchip to be picked up by the scanning antenna.

In addition, the RFID tag may be of one of two types. Active RFID tags have their own power source; the advantage of these tags is that the reader can be much farther away and still get the signal. Even though some of these devices are built to have up to a 10 year life span, they have limited life spans. Passive RFID tags, however, do not require batteries, and can be much smaller and have a virtually unlimited life span.

RFID tags can be read in a wide variety of circumstances, where barcodes or other optically read technologies are useless.

The tag need not be on the surface of the object (and is therefore not subject to wear)
The read time is typically less than 100 milliseconds
Large numbers of tags can be read at once rather than item by item.

Ok. Be an ass hole. Have fun with that. Its gotten you so far in life. I was just pointing out that you have a problem that you need to have checked out and you get pissy with me!? Idk wtf is your problem lately but it's ferry a really old. Don't blame me for whatever it is that's making you miserable cause it damn sure isn't me. I paid you 550 bucks this month. I'm doing more than my fair share and would be nice to be treated as such. But I still treat me like shit. When was the last time you helped me with something? You are constantly coming up with excuses to not help me. Like. Ending my oil or helping me with my new home I'm buying. Things that a good father should want to do with his son. Especially being how we didn't have that kind of relationship while I was growing up but instead your too busy. I don't have a clue with what cause your house is running down so I know it not working on it. But yet you still can't make time for anyone. And then on top of that I have to pay for pills I get from you like I'm a customer? I understand you need money, I do too. But that's still ridiculous. Connie gives her son pills w/o pay. So it's not like its some unreasonable thing. But I do it to help you. And yet this is how I get treated in return. Damn you are a fucking ass hole.

Had my appointment at Property Management today, but left feeling slightly suspicious of their possible agendas. 
After looking at their website, I discovered that it is a family run business and this makes me distinctly uncomfortable. It is these sorts of service providors that can stab you in the back at a moments notice. I might have a look at some of the properties that they have, but I will be a little dubious of them period.

Tried fiddling around with the settings, but to no avail. Not sure whether the app takes over the default notifications settings or not (?) but there is no mention of this. Maybe it's not compatible with my Galaxy Note 1.

It is, and hopefully over time, more developers will implement the Casting feature using the Google Cast SDK so that you can use it for more than just Netflix, Chrome and YouTube. I watched the launch event as well as the Motorola one this morning, Google has a lot of things going for it. But as you stated, Netflix is a US service that is only just available in UK and Nordic countries, so in Spain it not available (yet) and certainly not in Cyprus - which leaves you with only chrome and Youtube 

The device you own, HTC Media Link HD does the same thing, in essence, as it mirrors your phone on the tv, and allows you to do other things while your pictures or videos locally stored in your phone are played on the tv. The only noticeable bonus for the Chromecast is that it loads things from the Internet rather than your phone. However given its low price, its not a costly experiment for the living room. I have looked into buying one simply because I don't have the media link and this is a cheap viable option. However you'd need to find out where you can purchase one  

Love Hugo!

Do we need to arrange another evening drinking session ?
We all need tequila
Have you seen only God forgives ? If so what did you think of it ?
I've watched it. Its pretty interesting. Its not the type of film that should be shown at the mainstream cinema though. People won't get it. Not enough dialogue for the average cinema goer. Its got some gnarly themes and characters are all pretty damaged. I enjoyed it though
It reminds me of a lot of early miike where images and scenes to drive the story as opposed to dialogue
Also the main thai woman in it is fine as hell
Tequila later

Mike, 
As of right now it looks like the coil is out of my inventory. In the work order on my end I put in the internal notes that coil was sent to Florida for investigation. I am seeing a lot of emails now. Is there anything I need to do?

Okay. 

The lock in is this Friday at 7. 
Unfortunately we can only have kids in the benson and bailey youth groups and their parents or guardians be apart this time around. 
We will provide pizza and drinks. If you want other snacks please bring them. Feel free to bring any appropriate movies and games. 
If you play an instrument and want to practice together please do bring it. 
Bring your own bedding. 
And parents please pick up your child by 10am. 
Hope to see many of you this weekend!

Well, I wiped it and, upon signing back into your ID, everything came back and there is a system update available. Victory. 
Yeah. Common is just a point at which all things can ground to in the original cloudtoid, I just soldered all the grounds to the case. Lately, I've been using a wire twist. You can also use a terminal block. Also, in my later schematics, instead of an NC switch, I just use a normally open switch on the main power. The switch just has to be rated high enough to not blow with the power of the connector. That way, you can just leave the switch pin of the okr empty instead of the NC or a step down. 
I hope someday for it to be less relevant to me. 
Wow. JBQ quit. A sad day for Android.

Hi Nick,

Our use case is as follows:
We operate a let-only property portal primarily for Scottish letting agents. We aim to utilize the information available through yelp to improve the user experience for visitors of our landing pages (http://www.lettingweb.com/flats-to-rent/edinburgh for example).

These are pages that perform a specific location based search that we push heavily on the SEO front. We hope to add a map to the page showing businesses and locations of merit relevant to the context of a user looking to live in the given area defined by the page. So, for Edinburgh, we would be displaying parks, food, and activities to name a few - on a map and also showing review snippets for each. (in accordance with display reqs of course)

Re: cashing - to give our visitors the best possible set of interactive data each page would be populated with the results of 5 or more yelp api requests (one for each relevant category we want to display). Of our catalogue of landing pages, approx 320 different pages are hit each day. This makes an estimate of a minimum1600 api requests per day if we were to cache yelp data for 24hours. 

Naturally I don't like such a high number, and thought it may be possible to hold the data for up to 72 hours. We are not so much concerned with having real time information for our users, but more interested in giving them something else to look at and play with, and hopefully a reason to return to our site in future. No other UK property portal has anything like this available for their visitors.

Regards 

Andrew

When there is nothing to process, nothing is updated. Their properties will only change when a feed with data is processed.

And only when a property with a matching branch id is found are the agent's properties considered 'updated'. 

It has nothing to do with the file, but instead depends on properties in the file being matched to the agent. Without that, nothing happens, not even archiving.

Cheers 

Andrew

I'm to the point where I don't enjoy these MLS All-Star games. We put together the best of the league to play a prominent from usually Europe. The problem is that we are playing a team and not a group of guys who are usually on opposite sides of the ball. I don't like it and it makes our league look horrible.

I would not consider myself as a right wing fundamentalist. I am a Christ follower. I believe that somewhere down the line, evangelicals got added into this definition. As an evangelical Christian, I am called to evangelize. The writer was dedicating this piece to conservatives and trying to contrast them with liberal Christians.I feel that he sees only two groups of Christians that are opposite each other. However, there is more than the two groups. I know because I don't fit in either. Between you and I, though I am jobless, we tithe and even support a young boy in a very impoverished nation. As a family, we try to love others as ourselves, with our hands and feet and with what financial blessings we've been allotted by Jesus Christ. I do believe in a literal 6 days of Creation, but don't do so blindly. We have been tasked by our Creator God to take care of the Earth. As for war, I do believe there are legitimate reasons to fight, but I don't know if I have seen one since Hitler tried to take over the world and eradicate races. I am not for the American dream, but see it as a tool of Satan. God is first above family and money. However, I have been entrusted with many blessings and am called by God to be a good steward of them. See Ephesians 5. Women and men do have different roles. This doesn't mean they are to be confined to the house barefoot and pregnant. They are man's counterpart and helper. As Genesis states, He made both of them in His image. Just as Christ is God and equal to God. So is woman to man. Jesus submitted to God and His will. The wife is to do likewise. This doesn't mean I dictate everything, but rather we are to work together and if there is a disagreement with our direction, I am to seek council from the Lord in prayer. He works hearts and can change even the man's heart to understand the woman. 
I could go on and on. All of this to say I'm glad I'm like neither the writer or the subject. My problem with the liberal Christian worldview is that it fails to live up to the mandate given to us by Christ in Acts 1:8. It's all about a political view. As for the right wingers, they also have bastardized the Gospel with their worldview. Both fail to love their neighbor.

Like how expensive? 
The problem I have with it is that it's not going to change what the organization says its name is. We could use this same approach anywhere, but he'd be better off writing a piece about how this offends a people group with quotes from said people. The Washington Bullets changed to the Wizards, so anything is possible. However, I'm sure they'd lose a ton of money and fans. I wonder what they could change it to. 
Wow! 
Makes me think of how they wouldn't say Voldemort's name in Harry Potter.
Not sure if they have it here. 
I see what you're saying. I just don't think it's going to be a catalyst. 
I'll have to check it out. 
In this case, I'm sensing a one and done. 
If they did, I could envision the NFL pulling their weight to make them sorry for trying. This isn't just a Washington issue. It's also an NFL issue.

Well, I'm teaching Sunday School for the first time tomorrow. It's for the 4th graders. Those of you who pray, please do. 
I just had to post an acronym after seeing a post with so many that I had to take the time to figure them all out. 
Happy Birthday! 
Trust me. I know what I'm doing! 
Thanks!

Up woke the Fox and he found it was Spring.
?It?s tough to sleep when the birds are all singing.?
So he stretched his legs to go for a stroll.
?So long my little home,? he said to his foxhole.

Thanks to the dev for this one. It's a very lightweight and minimalistic approach to sms/mms which is great considering all the bloated sms/mms apps out there. I love the way it handlesn picture messages, filling the entire "bubble" with content.   My only request: MMS over Wifi DOES work, but only if you still have data enabled in the background. I like to have keep my data turned off while my Wifi is on to conserve battery. Under these circumstances (wifi on, data off) the stock messaging app knows to enab

That's cool. 
So, what makes her your girl? :)
Ahhhh...got it. Sneaking through the woods huh? 
Oh so it was like a nature hike? :)
I am just messing with you. So when do you see her next? 
So she is a redneck woman? 
Ok
Let me see if Val has any questions? 
Yeah she is cute 
She thinks we have covered everything for now. 
Hahaha. That made her laugh.

Looks like the phone had nothing to do with our texting issues. 
I am done with my 8. I have 2 more this morning and 2 this afternoon. 
I didn't. 
I guess I will call them back. Grrr. 
We should definitely go. We will bring the wine holders this time too! 
Oh gosh. I have no idea. I am terrible at that stuff. I would be happy to contribute though.

That probably works. If we are going to trade you can definitely up my contribution!

Just finished eating. I need to do the same! 
Thanks Dana. I can handle validation and remediation if needed when I get to the store in the am. 
That's my plan too. I am doing half day on Friday so I plan on busting it out Friday and Saturday morning. 
9343

I sure do miss you sweetie! 
9343

Yeah, I think I am done too. I have one more load of laundry to swap out though.

I know! I thought I had saved it but apparently not! 
I was out too. I had to be in a little early so I am a little sleepy too!

It would be tough to squeeze it in today. You also caught me on a casual day!

Sorry! Crazy morning being at the store first and then stuck in meetings. 
If mike can come over either night that would be great!

I have never been a fan of photographing people!

Cool! 
Me too! I am really looking forward to it. 
Thanks. 
You sent me one the other night that was very pretty. I usually do sunrises ;)
Yes! 
That would be a blast!

Looking cute as ever! 
Yay! I am glad everyone is ok!

Ok. Did you want to be there too or should I just have him come whenever? 
Ok sweetie. I wasn't sure how long you were planning on staying at the retirement. 
Are you sure that is the right number? 
That makes it nice! 
Hahaha that's ok! 
Apparently no one else has it yet so they were just getting rejected! 
I am home now so whenever is best for you. 
Do you need directions or did Val already tell you how to get here? 
Ok. 1113 St Andrews Ct Akron 44312 
Ok. I'll be here. 
Mike is going to come now. Well sort of. He has to stop at home first and get gas. 
Hahaha! I am beginning to wonder if I will get to see you tonight! ;)
Me too baby! 
Just got home. I am so sleepy tonight! 
That would feel wonderful! 
And I bet whatever came after would feel even better! 
All done with mike! 
Yeah it went fine. 
Should I head your way? 
I would be happy to come to you since I am all done. 
Ok! I might have to stop for gas but we will see! 
Ok. I am on my way. I think I am going to need to stop. 
Ok!

I like it much better when I am there too!

I have no idea. You'll have to show me what you are doing. 
You make me happier then I ever knew I could be! 
No. Once you add it to the library you should be able to put it into a playlist 
Its so lonely here without you. 
I miss you so much! 
I don't like it either sweetie. It is so much nicer having you next to me! 
Yeah
Definitely!

That doesn't sound good! 
Is this the one that was at 4:30?
I am done! 
9343

How is your afternoon sweetie? 
Yay! I am officially on vacation! 
Don't I wish! 
Yes! I am trying to start cleaning but I keep finding ways to get distracted! 
Just got home. I need to get a jump on cleaning and laundry. You?

Nope. We always try to go somewhere new.

Did you escape yet sweetie?

Yay! I just finished scrubbing the carpet potatoes. Then Hobo peed on it. 
Hahaha! They are a lot like pet frogs! 
Although I suppose my carpet is probably dirty enough to grow potatoes! 
I'll be out of town on vacation. You are being bs'd.
Hahaha! 
I would hate to make them sad. 
Hahaha. Ok!

That works. I will take flip flops too. 
Do you have swimming trunks here? 
I would trust your opinion more then anyone else I can think of! 
I just don't know what to do next sweetie. :(
Do you have swimming trunks at moms? 
Me too baby but at least we have some time to figure it out. 
At least I have spilled my guts so I don't have to worry about carrying a secret! 
Should I run to Kohl's in the am?

It is close. You sure you wouldn't have real swimming trunks?

Sorry sweetie. :(
I know. I just feel bad about dragging you into it.

Volleyball 
I would like to be apart of the fall volleyball season. Let me know what the fees are and I will have it paid as soon as possible. I think there was another email I needed to reply to about a dinner or party, but I can't remember what the details where. If it was about availability then I am free any day at the moment.

Canceled Plans 
I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning so playing in the fall softball league may be difficult. 

I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning. It should be roughly a thirty day job but can always turn into more or less. I will know more next week, but I wanted to let you know asap so you can make the right decision for the team to maybe move me back to a substitute. The job could end before the season starts but like I said I'll know a little more next week. 
Back to Lafayette for work come Monday. It should be more profitable this time, lol.

I should be able to make it to the game then! They switched me to work in Terre Haute for four tens! Yes, I love four tens.

@PopeSnogginheim that's all I've been saying, too. Don't be a coward about it. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries we've indoctrinated western culture? Because I think most cultures are male dominated and sorely overlooked the importance of respecting women in general. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries Black American culture has indoctrinated western civilization's culture? It seems most cultures, globally, are male dominated and most have sorely overlooked and downplayed the importance of respecting women and how important women are to any society in general. 
To go further; it seems this lack of respect/recognition of importance, is more damaging to black women. Stereotypically, black women already have such a damaged reputation (which I don't subscribe to personally), depsite the fact this idea of black women being relegated to baby mama's, gold diggers, and women of promiscuity aren't true in the majority of cases. 
I think the truth -like with most stereotypes- is that a small percentage of women validate a false overarching stereotype that imprison the majority of women who aren't really like that. 
Am I wrong for viewing it this way? I am not a woman (no surprise), so I don't know what women go through, but I would like a better understanding. 
I think all people under the boot of malicious stereotypes and damaging reputations seem to put this faux sense of responsibility and intense pressure on themselves to fix or change a problem that most likely isn't theirs to begin with...

I thought Vick said he forgave Cooper and that LeSean McCoy said that it was too big. I could be wrong. 

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--michael-vick-helping-to-clean-up-riley-cooper-s-mess-193236048.html 

To change direction... It's strange how some of the same people who generally never forgave Vick for what he did, are now rushing to decide what is and isn't forgivable for others coupled with how quickly they should move on. But the N-word is the double standard they want to focus on?
How overt is enough?

A lifetime ban is excessive, because I do believe people have the capacity to change.... but since we are focusing this on Vick's story; anyone care to talk about the hypocrisy of never forgiving Vick, but demanding people get over this and forgive Cooper because he apologized? Vick apologized to and did his time.

That said at least Cooper's apology seemed genuine and he wasn't looking to blame the usual suspects (pun intended) for his own doing.

[quote="Gonzo"]Warren Sapp was a one-of-a-kind defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his bust in Canton will be the first of its kind.

Sapp could have been bald on his bust. He had that look for most of his years in Tampa Bay, actually, and had a shaved head for his biggest moment, when the Buccaneers won a Super Bowl. He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe?

[quote="BoogieOnDa360"][quote="NYG Hitstick"]Michael Vick, who said on Wednesday that he had forgiven Cooper, acknowledged on Thursday that emotions were running high and a volatile situation wasn't going to settle down any time soon.

"I tried to defuse it for a day, but I can't make it go away," Vick told reporters via ESPN the Magazine. "I can't do that. It's too big."

Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but how is this Vick backing off the forgiveness train? All he said is that he can't make the situation go away, which is true. He said he forgave him. What more is he supposed to do? And what does him being an ex-con have to do with him being offended. I guess he loses that right from now huh? McCoy is the one saying that he doesn't respect Cooper anymore. Shouldn't that be the headline?[/quote]

What other white billionaire can you look at and say the same? And I mean with out knowing who they are, what they own, or what they're driving? Like Tom Ford or Armani suits have big ass logos... Cmon now. 
Well I definitely agree with that. The more appropriate term is implicit bias. We all have those. 
I don't disagree with any of that really... And I don't really know fashion like that either. 

I agree that it's true, we all have implicit biases... I'm just saying - it's one thing to be uncertain what a billionire looks like when they come in to your store to shop. It's another to be certain of who isn't a billionaire based on what they look like and treat them a certain way because of it. It is a mixture of both classism and racism because the assumed limit and treatment based on the assumed limit.

Kevin... If the minimum wage is raised to $15 bucks at fast food joint it highly unlikely 
Kevin, If the minimum wage is raised to $15 bucks at fast food joint for a cook or a cashier, it highly unlikely that they will get any salary increase of significance.... Unless moving up to a management role. 
Also, with a raise in minimum wage typically leads to a raise in almost all salaries... Or else most would quit their gig - unless they really enjoyed it - and start working at the closest ff joint.. Which would logically result in more competitive salaries based on the number of people qualified and the market for any given position. 
The fact that your wife makes less than $14 an hour is a result of the current minimum wage... Because if they raise it, she could work retail in the mall and make more than she does now. That would put pressure on her employer to make a decision... If he values her work. It would be hard to fill any position that pays less than the minimum wage because at that point people can take easier jobs that pay better... Which The key factor in your comparison to the military is unbalanced because as Chris explained the military do not incur the other living expenses that a fast food worker would (healthcare, room, and board etc) so those two aren't that comparable. However, the argument itself seems to be coming from a moralistic perspective and kind of sententious in foundation. That takes any possibility of a logical approach to your point of view

In her defense, she campaigned hard to be the monkey in Choke.
@KristiNoem PRISM. Irony.
And Marie Mathews is 16 years old and a Conneticut teenager at Archie Andrews High School. She's editor of the school paper and has a shot to graduate early, with an academic scholarship. Which bugs her. 
Why? The first semester is almost over, and she's doing very well. This is the first year being head of the class is possible. It nags at her though, because her old friend and neighbor Angel Glover used to be first in their class. 
Angel had been the top student, but then over the summer his Dad was in an incident with a mugger and was shot dead. Angel apparently hasn't been dealing with it very well; he shows up late to class constantly, and he wears heavy sweaters constantly to apparently cover bruises. Rumors persist that he's getting into drugs or gangs; harsher rumors sat he's prostituting himself. 
And isn't one to believe rumors though, and tries reaching out to her friend. She's also a little curious where they stand, because they made out a little at a Fourth of July harvests, before his Dad died. Angel is very curt though, brushing her off. 
The scholarship Ann wants typically goes to whoever wins the Science Award at the end of the year. She has competition from Angel, as well as Irene, who is much more ruthless than either. Items would rather not have her competition be a factor anymore.

Where is the mountain ?

I notice no difference in the snappiness, but love the new settings! 
Salim
Sali
Bataya na CAP se door ki college me hua. Toh 
The keyboard is definitely snappier, and the new settings are amazing. (whenever I try to intentionally miss the space, and enter a new word, it doesn't work, but that isn't a feature that was absolutely necessary... So, awesome work guys! )
One suggestion. Most of the time, I don't really miss the space, but the keyboard registers it as a few separate letters. 

Like, 

"Fleksy is awesome! " 

Becomes 

Fleksy isgjaersome 

Between is and awesome, the keyboard registered the letters gj, or gh, or hj. 

Would it be possible for the keyboard to recognise when this happens, and change "isgjawesome" to "is awesome" 

It would be a really neat feature, what do you think guys?

     Everyone was pointing out at something in the distance, with terrified faces. Aditya got up from his seat, made his way through the crowd, while maintaining his balance in the shaky local train. Local trains in India, are quite different, compared to other countries. The biggest difference being that their doors are always open, whether the train is stationary, or moving. And the trains shook a lot. Enough to make a person unable to maintain balance without holding on to something.
And yes, we are being unable to contact rahima, (we are getting the message 'the number you have dialed is not in service'). Please give us the correct contact number.

Natural disaster 
Once there was a boy named bruno. He had 2 siblings. They all had become happy during summer vacations, so they told their dad they want to go to Miami for a picnic. 

After 3 days, they left in their car, and were on their way. But, just 4 km before their destination, their car broke down. So they all got off, and decided to walk. But just then, they were attacked by elephants! 

bruno's dad used a saw to fight all 18 elephants , and killed everyone of them. They continued walking. 

After 21 days, they finally reached miami, but they were feeling very amazing . So they all went to relax in their hotel. 

The next day, they all went to the beach, and we're relaxing, when super star mike posner came running, with a mob of 6 people behind him for autographs. Suddenly, * walked up to *, and said, run for your lives! 

Suddenly, the ground began shaking violently. * saw in the distance, that a *natural disaster* was approaching. Suddenly, the ground below him gave way, and he fell down, only to wake up in his bed.

The bottom is a four by four grid. So 4x4=16. Next is 3 by 3. Which means 9. Next is 2 by 2. Which means 4 balls. Next is one ball. 

Therefore, 16+9+4+2=30

?Andy wants a job as a signalman on the railways. He is told to meet the inspector at the signal box. The inspector puts this question to him: "What would you do if you realised that two trains were heading for each other on the same track?"Andy says, "I would switch the points for one of the trains.""What if the lever broke?" asked the inspector. "Then I'd dash down out of the signal box," said Andy, "and I'd use the manual lever over there." "What if that had been struck by lightning?" "Then," Andy continues, "I'd run back into the signal box and phone the next signal box." "What if the phone was engaged?" "Well in that case," persevered Andy, "I'd rush down out of the box and use the public emergency phone at the level crossing up there." "What if that was vandalised?" "Oh well then I'd run into the village and get my uncle Silas."This puzzles the inspector, so he asks, "Why  would you do that?" Came the answer, "Because he's never seen a train crash."

This is interesting but difficult case because they need it back by September 10 at the latest. And now it seems that we still have not eliminated all the bugs yet. The sooner we get this back the sooner we could have this all solved.

Goto list accounts and change all passwords there. Should be 4-5 accounts. 

I don't think email is compromised as this was due a bug in wp or web files, but change them nonetheless. 

After changing waste and dev password, you can use dev folder for new uploads which I'll merge with backup later.

I know. Its Thursday lol. Holy shit. This has been the most unproductive week of my life. 
We always do somehow~ 

Lmao I just want things my way. 
Um yes. A bunch of people have asked me how to block numbers on their iphones. Turns out you have to jail break. Yuck. 
Grouping ? The automatic folder names ? I like that we can have this convo lmao. 

Oh we're keeping track of insults now ??

Forever:)

Lmaoooo I know I read it and killed myself but whatever test me. 
Um no. I was thinking about that the other day. And came to the conclusion that I don't ever not want to see you for that long of a period. 

Sure. So um your existence and pure basic goal in life is to reproduce ( basic level , don't get your lace panties in a bunch) and nature has given women

Nothing worth mentioning. Biggest thing I did this week was changing the part in my car and getting my social security card redone. Depressing. 

I wish ! I am really getting into design though. Like getting an itch to learn and do shit. In terms of aesthetic design. So maybe soon I'll just say "download my app" 
Like the gray slate thing that pops up?
I haven't experienced group messaging but I'm sure it sucks. Actually....yes. I have but not with iPhone. Some bitch decided to send a group msg because of number change and ten others texted back. That sucked. 

Haha you're right it wouldn't even be a fair contest.

Everything. You can change the dpi of the phone. So you can like have different apps with different dpis. If you want like an app in tablet mode instead of regular phone mode. There's halo which basically this little ball that allows you multitask way better. The kernels give great battery life and just so much crap. Finally satisfied with a rom lol.

Please I need your help. Thanks.

I don't think there's such a. Inc AD bad pictures. I think my friends are great no matter what and will look beautiful or handguns no matter the lense or the pose. 
:(
I don't think there's such a thing as a bad picture of my friend. I think if anything what this pictures show is how great they always are and how they-ewpecially you two- look beautiful/handsome in every picture no matter the pose, lightning or angle. 
Nooooo we live your selfies.  Don't listen to that stupid article. 
That wasn't a typo, we live vicariously through your selfies

There is very little literature available on the human crop maker. Where it does exist it is often critical to the point of scathing. It frequently portrays them as liars, shoddy artists or the agents of a conspiracy to discredit the genuine phenomenon. 
Three notable exceptions to the rule can still be tracked down. Jim Schabel admitted to his role as a circle maker in 2003's Round in Circles, whilst John Macnish went deeper - albeit as an outsider spending time with the circle makers - in the same year's Cropcircle Apocalypse. 
More recent is the 2006 edition of The Field Guide by Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg. It is the most revealing of the three titles, revealing much of the pair's philosophy as practicing circle makers. However, over lunch one summer afternoon in 2011, Irving put it to me that The Field Guide is no longer relevant; it is now an artifact of one team and their philosophy at a certain point in time. Things have moved on. 
Leading circle makers have parted from the scene, leaving a different generation behind. It is one that does not necessarily abide by a code of silence and is bereft, for the moment at least, of grand masters. Amongst its ranks are those who believe the circles are no more than aesthetic art, albeit that which is made in locations rife with paranormal activity. 
In short, the crop circle fraternity is a very different place to the one it was in 2006. As of 2013 both Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg had withdrawn from the fields except in cases of paid commissions. One rather cutting wit has described the current state of affairs as the 'end of days'. I do not share such a fully apocalyptic vision. We are talking crop circles as opposed to Dr Strangelove or On the Beach. But there are lessons to be learned from the past; some of which are not widely known. They demonstrate how and when a crop circle is most powerful.

crop circle challenge
http://www.lucypringle.co.uk/

To the general public crop circles frequently present a dichotomy. You either go with the true believers who are convinced the circles are made by extraterrestrials, or you side with the skeptics, often represented by the despised human circle makers. 
When I allowed myself to get close to the circles by relentlessly pursuing them around Wiltshire I naively believed this false dilemma. It took two and a half years to completely change my viewpoint. There is no big conflict of ideologies. Rather, there are possibilities. 
An area or pattern of flattened plants can become a venue for all kinds of paranormal or profound experiences. Researcher Lucy Pringle has noted people suffering from Parkinson's disease undergo temporary relief from their symptoms. Electronic equipment fails and animals display unusual behaviour. People from different walks of life are brought together when they would otherwise not meet. Children will lecture skeptical adults on why their doubt is ill founded. 
Overall, circles photographer Steve Alexander is not incorrect to call his website Temporary Temples; that is what the crop circles are. However, experiences do not necessarily take place without consideration as to how the crop circles appear. No matter anyone's view on paranormal involvement, the spectre of the human circle maker lurks in the shadows. 
There is very little literature available on the people who make crop circles. Where it does exist it is often critical to the point of scathing. It frequently portrays them as liars, shoddy artists or the agents of a conspiracy to discredit the genuine phenomenon. 
Three notable exceptions to the rule can still be tracked down. Jim Schabel admitted to his role as a circle maker in 2003's Round in Circles, whilst John Macnish went deeper - albeit as an outsider spending time with the circle makers - in the same year's Cropcircle Apocalypse. 
More recent is the 2006 edition of The Field Guide by Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg. It is the most revealing of the three titles, revealing much of the pair's philosophy as practicing circle makers. However, over lunch one summer afternoon in 2011, Irving put it to me that The Field Guide is increasingly irrelevant; it is now an artifact of one team and their philosophy at a certain point in time. Things have moved on. 
Leading circle makers have parted from the scene, leaving a different generation behind. It is one that does not necessarily abide by a code of silence and is bereft, for the moment at least, of grand masters. Amongst its ranks are those who believe the circles are no more than aesthetic art, albeit that which is made in locations rife with paranormal activity. 
In short, the crop circle fraternity is a very different place to the one it was in 2006. One rather cutting wit has described the current state of affairs as the 'end of days'. I do not share such a fully apocalyptic vision. We are talking crop circles as opposed to Dr Strangelove or On the Beach. But there are lessons to be learned from the past; episodes to be revisited by any circle maker who does not want to see the phenomenon collapse. They demonstrate the crop circle is most powerful when it is what Irving's former colleague Rod Dickinson described as 'the thing that propels the plot along, evoking a whole set of desires and beliefs and the promise of something bigger.' Often, that desire involves the attempts of individuals to place their own version of truth upon the matter of the circles' origins, purpose and meaning. 




'Perhaps one day it will revert to occasional, relatively small outbreaks in the vicinity of Warminster and the Wiltshire/Hampshire border, echoing a time, not so long ago, when an unassuming man saw magic in communion with our mystical landscapes and acted upon it.'

@StAndrewsCS thank you for your help, I may be emailing soon! 
I think being at work today has helped me relax and calm down after this morning 
That's quite good! What I would try and put more emphasis on us why universities might want me and stress those reasons. Its ok if it's more than a small paragraph as it's down to my housemaster to whittle it down to fit and pick the best bits which I do whiff him. But again very good

There are things worse then kids doing that. If they graduate school that's all that matters. They got issues and they have parents who should be helping can't blame them if there parents aren't doing shit about it. 
Don't hate the curious kids. Make a status about the middle schoolers parents. 
You're pointing out the wrong source of people here
Right that's not the kids fault for listening to that is it? Can't blame them. Can't blame them for living in this type of society. 
Right that's not the kids fault for listening to that is it ? They weren't here long enough to make that type of music popular. Can't blame them. Can't blame them for living in this type of society either. 
You can't blame them for ruining society just cause. You can't jump to conclusion that when they become adults and graduate that they'll continue doing 
You can't blame them for ruining society when they haven't even done anything. It may be your opinion that they will but you can't confront them of it when they haven't had a chance. 
So in the end all you can do is give them a chance cause even if the economy
There's also a thing called giving chances and not stereotyping a group of kids. Cause in the end there kids and your opinion or anyone else's won't stop 
Yeah! And okayyy :/ 
There's also a thing called giving chances and not stereotyping a group of kids. Cause in the end there kids. I'm not agreeing that's right but you just can't say cause they do that they'll ruin whatever you said they would. Kinda a stretch there

Belly button but that's only cause I'm not a fan of nipple piercings. But you should get what you want! Are you leaning towards one?
Well, it's really what you want that matters. A lot of it depends on the style of piercing as well like if it's decorative, or a ring or barbell. It's what will make you happy :)
Well I don't know, this salad is pretty yummy ;) jk jk
I'm funny. I'm sure you're better than a salad ;)

The wine social at Ardesia (and ardesia in general) looks pretty cool! I'd be down with that. The tasting on the boat sounds sooo fun but 'tis a bit pricey! What should we do for dinner? I was thinking going back to Frankie's could be fun but it's not close to ardesia (I'm cool with taking the subway tho). Or we could always cook yummy stuff altho my place is a mess and I forgot to take the trash out last night. What do y'all think?

Hi! Do you have a favorite version of mario kart?? My friend has the gamecube version but I have a huge soft spot for the n64 one. What other games do you play? I also love your movie interests curious about what baking you do (I love to cook but don't bake a lot, mostly because my oven is scary). You're also really cute haha 

I'd love to hear back from you and chat sometime :)

You up? 
What time are you going to open house? 
Yeah. 
Although really it'll only slow us down because then Alaina and Sam won't be able to get there. Its be easier if we stayed at your current house or we all stayed at our own houses. 
And then we just met in the morning. 
Yeah but isn't it really far away? 
Well we could all meet there, right? Because now Alaina and Sam will have to wake up like 2 hours early. 
Oh he's half an hour the other way. Okay that makes way more sense now okay. 
Okay. 
I'm going to the night one. I've got driving today. 
I could maybe just go to alainas in the morning and you guys could pick me and her up at the same time. 
Okay. I gtg I'll talk later. 
I would guess the night one wince you have reversal, right? 
Hey sorry I was driving. 
The night one. 
Sorry didn't hear the first text. 
You don't have anything to be sorry about. You need a ride, its as simple as that. 
And its not like you're way out of the way of where we're going regardless. 
What's the matter? 
I've got time. 
She says she's only nice to nice people. Told you she loves you. 
:)
So what's going on today that's so bad? 
We aren't going to be able to get to the one at 4 so I guess I'll pick you up at 5. 
Or I'll see you there or whatever we're doing. 
If you get a camera issue like op, ignore it. The phone is great and I've had it for months with no issues at all. Sure, there's always a bad egg, but no company can help that. Op should just be glad it didn't explode like some bad egged samsung phones. 
Yay for reps! 
Well that's bullshit. Verizon gets worse in my book every day. 
Busy right now, what do you need? 
May I'm busy right now sorry. I've gotta get a passport and then I've got to go to open house. 
*nah 
I believe that looks like board. 
Miui doesn't 
I would if I could. And I love you too, Charlie! <3
Miui doesn't really fit. Try flatcons or tiny white. 
Okay. 
Well then I don't need his opinion.

I almost typed undressing instead of intimidating. I'm bad at typing with one hand. -_-
Hahaha well only he would know it was you. You could do witness protection of you really wanted. 
No they don't really use for for tattle tailing but you change your name and move where nobody knows who you are. 
I said yes. 
Yeah no. 
I'm not getting whatever you sent. 
Silly verizon. 
Okay there we go. 
By the way... 
So when we were talking about bennet in my driveway on Monday, I realized it sounded like I was trying to tell you what can and will you happy. I can't do that. If going to bennet will make you happy, then by all means do it. I just don't think it's the best decision for anybody, and especially you. 
Still not getting whatever you send. 
*sent. 
Did you even send something? 
Alright. But seriously, don't switch :)
Your texts are taking forever to send. 
Hahaha
I was going to say something else but now I completely forget what it was.

My dad hasn't texted back yet. 
Okay fine. Discussion over then. 
Sorry. 
Get in shape. Or something like that I think. I forget how to connotation went. 
That sucks. He'll be fine. 
That's why I don't know how to tell my parents because I'm afraid that's how they'll react and then they won't let me join. 
Yeah that's the plan at some point. I just don't know when or how because they I a no idea at all. Like they think I want to he a graphic designer. Little bit of a difference there. 
Yes please do that. My family isn't the sit down kind of type.

If it happens again, try holding it under a bright light and hard resetting. Sometimes (rarely) the proximity sensor can bug out and say the phone is in a pocket, so it reflects any button presses.

Hi Yin. Just sent 150 downpayment 
Version: 1.0 RC17 (17)
OS: 4.3
Model: Nexus 4

Just wanted to comment on how great an app I think this is.

Used Tasker and Llama extensively but at the end of the day, its too much trouble with logic and the interface is just ugly.

The simplicity and design of your apps are really great. Sometimes less is more.

Just a few comments, firstly for the Sleep Agent would be nice if white listed calls go through. I like the implementation of other companies where a double call within a given time will allow the call to go through. The white list would also be nice if I could just select all contacts or favorites from the address book.

Secondly, would be great to have an Agent for silence during meetings. Something that integrates with Google calendar.

Finally, integration with NFC Task Launcher would be great. For example activating Sleep Agent with NFC would be great for naps.

Please keep up the great work. Personally I would pay for individual Agent functions (kind of like a mini android market)

In Asia language is a prerequisite but is not enough to communicate. You need to know the culture to communicate. How many people actually cover these criteria. I have as I moved with my father who was in a role I want to be in.

?In Asia language is a prerequisite but is not enough to communicate. You need to know the culture to communicate. How many people actually cover these criteria. I have as I moved with my father who was in a role I want to be in.

People who speak the language but have never lived in the country so don't understand the culture.

Lived in the country and went to international school. My case was a deliberate choice. No one speaks your language or had been to your country.

The monsters move between thoughts. Long ago our ancestors fought this. They gave us the ability to understand. It has been lost with time, unfortunately. Although, some say, when we see movement out of the corner of our eyes or something that looks out of place (such as the aforementioned flicker of motion) its our brain reacting to them. The ability has been lost. The reflex is still as alive as ever.

Visions of johan
3/3 or 3/4
Hmm. Is the melody going to be country ish or no? 
Progression won't be. That's the progression for the majority of country, blues, and rock songs. 
That's what I'm thinking for everything. Have a pretty normal country song with different instruments and then just mess it up note by note 
Folk is an acoustic guitar. Blues is a guitar bass and drums. Country is a fiddle, banjo, guitars, drums, bass, lap steel, piano... 
From that lesson with country music? 
Yes

Can I ask you about your personal journey? Like how often do you read your Bible and do you have a system to it? 
I had just been feeling like I need to get into a daily habit of reading and having some personal time set aside specifically for that reason and wanted to know about what other people do. 
Not that I'm modeling myself after you or anything, just that I could get something I've never thought of before that could work for me. 
Ok. 
I mostly just talk. I'll read Wednesday to find something to talk about at youth, which sounds bad, but I usually have been praying about what to teach on since Monday. These past couple weeks I have done relatively little lesson planning, but God has brought up some powerful things in youth. So I'm not worried about finding a lesson or anything so much as just personal growth and I have this love letter, why wouldn't I want to read it?

Fleksy 

Every single number and combination of numbers is contained in pi. Take the first billion decimals of pi. At some point the first billion decimals are repeated. I don't know where it starts, perhaps the first billion are repeated at the trillionth decimal. Assume that is true and the one billion and oneth place is 7. Then the first billion numbers occur again in the same order from one trillion to the one trillion and one billionth places. But the one trillion one billion and oneth place is 3 this time. So it's not rational. Also the proof posted here is really good. Euler (think eulers method, f(x), popularized pi, e as in e^x ) was the first one to prove sqrt(2) is irrational. 
Some benchmarking tools use formulas to calculate digits of pi as a way to measure how many calculations per second your computer can handle. That's a fairly good use for all the digits of pi but it's not really using the digits, just the formula. 
We could never calculate all the digits of pi, not even at the rate of one quadrillion digits per second or more. Why? Because pi has an infinite amount of decimals. As far as we know now, there are no real applications for calculating more than about 20 digits. Think about it. If you are calculating something with the precision of 20 digits the last few are so small they're practically zero. 0.00000000000000000001 is pretty much zero. Could you think of a task where being off by that much would have any significance?

What is your biggest fear?
That ask.fm will one day forget to make a really embarrassing anonymous!
Hottest sophomore, junior, and senior at Meadows? 
Can I just say I think we would get along fabulously?
Who's the hottest gay guy at your school?
I'm reading some of your questions and answers... Omg these are great xD
Do you think the B and T parts of LGBT sometimes get left behind? 
No. 
Jennifer hernandez
First thing's first: I don't really know any gay guys. I know OF gay guys, but I'm not close friends with any. Which is weird because I'm practically gay myself... But I digress. I'd have to say Bennett, he seems like a pretty chill guy and he's not unattractive. However a) I don't know him and b) he's in a relationship so that's out of the question anyway. 
Forgotten about. It seems like in the mad rush for "gay rights," trans rights are almost forgotten about, and biphobia and transphobia still run rampant, even among the gay community. 
At this point... None really. The few girls I've liked in the past didn't feel the same, and I'm fine with that now. And I don't really feel romantically about any girls right now. 
Honestly? Yes. I'm still trying to sort out who the fuck I am, it's so confusing... And I already came out as bi so to go back and say "lol jk I'm actually gay!" would just be... I don't know. Can I take a minute and just say how much I hate these arbitrary labels society makes us use? Ugh. I'm done. 
That depends on the person. There are some people I can talk about ANYTHING with. Others, I'm decidedly more reserved. If I trust you, I'll talk totally openly with you, simple as that.

Man it seems like what Kendrick said went over most people's (including all the response rapper's) heads... 
Lawd. The struggle with listening and comprehension skills in general is real. 
Kendrick basically said he was on their level, meaning those he considered great... Told the other noobs to step their game up and dropped the mic on some sexual chocolate shit... 
To be real he has no reason to go at them... Different generations. Besides there's nothing he can do to erase what they've accomplished. Like their is nothing LeBron can do to erase what MJ was to basketball in the 90's even if he surpassed him and breaks all his records. You have to respect each in their era. 
Hahahaha. I hear you. It's art, though. All this shit is subjective anyways.

Keyboard

Portal 

You probably want to type on your mobile device really fast but then you have to sacrifice typing error free. If you chose to type precise so you can type error free, you then have to sacrifice speed. There is just no way around it.... Until now! Introducing Fleksy, a mobile keyboard by a start-up named Syntellia, that aims to make you type so accurately while missing every single letter. 

This keyboard was ironically designed for blind people meaning that you can miss every single letter cause you don't have to look at the screen while tying making this very fast to use while still getting it accurate 98% of the time. For example in this entire paragraph I missed almost every single word and it corrected it correctly except for 3 or 4 words. Most of the time I was only hitting the home row of the keyboard instead of the actual letters! 

Since you don't have to be exact, you can shrink the keyboard to really small sizes. Not just are there 3 size options in the settings, you can combine this with the fact that the keyboard uses gestures to space, delete, and switch predictions, to completely get rid of the space bar row or make the keyboard invisible. Yes you heard me right, you can make the keyboard completely invisible! 

So how do you operate the keyboard without the space bar or in invisible mode. Well other than the standard flick right to space, flick left to delete, and flick up or down to switch suggestions , to capitalize you flick up on the bottom left. Similarly, you flick up on the bottom right to enter. Hold on these gestures will CAPS LOCK and Voice Search. Finally, flick from bottom left or right toward the center to get two different pages of symbols. But the most important gesture is probably the one to switch to the mini or invisible layouts, just flick down or up with two fingers. 

Now that we know the basics of this keyboard, let's go through the settings! First, there is an interactive tutorial that shows you how to use all the gestures. Second, there is a game that allows you to try to beat the Guiness World Record for a change to win a Nexus 7.

Because of Hitler, Britain was facing hardships in the ww2. They weren't even getting half the things they shouldve got under the Marshall plan. 

After 1947, Britain (and France too) withdrew their rule from various colonies like palestine, Egypt, sri lanka, etc. 

Had hit not been for Hitler, their role would have continued for another 30ish years, by which time gandhiji would have died naturally.

See here's what happened. 

I, Samarth, atishay, Srishita, and devang (I guess that's his name, in the f building he stays. ) were talking about ghosts. 

We were really freaked out, discussing bhool bhulaiya, then devang just said the word aathma (the movie). Every one (excluding me and devang) ran out of fear.

?QUIT! GIVE UP! YOU?RE BEATEN!? They shout and plead,
There?s just too much against you now, this time you can?t succeed.
And as I start to hang my head in front of failure?s face,
My downward fall is broken by the memory of a race.
And hope refills my weakened will as I recall that scene.
For just the thought of that short race rejuvenates my being.
A children?s race, young boys, young men; now I remember well.
Excitement, sure, but also fear; it wasn?t hard to tell.
They all lined up so full of hope. Each thought to win that race.
Or tie for first, or if not that, at least take second place.
And fathers watched from off the side, each cheering for his son.
And each boy hoped to show his dad that he would be the one.
The whistle blew and off they went, young hearts and hopes of fire.
To win, to be the hero there, was each young boy?s desire.
And one boy in particular, his dad was in the crowd,
Was running near the lead and thought, ?My dad will be so proud.?
But as he speeded down the field across a shallow dip,
The little boy who thought to win, lost his step and slipped.
Trying hard to catch himself, his hands flew out to brace,
And mid the laughter of the crowd, he fell flat on his face.
So down he fell and with him hope. He couldn?t win it now.
Embarrassed, sad, he only wished to disappear somehow.
But as he fell, his dad stood up and showed his anxious face,
Which to the boy so clearly said, ?Get up and win that race!?
He quickly rose, no damage done ? behind a bit, that?s all,
And ran with all his mind and might to make up for his fall.
So anxious to restore himself to catch up and to win,
His mind went faster than his legs. He slipped and fell again.
He wished that he had quite before with only one disgrace.
I?m hopeless as a runner now, I shouldn?t try to race.
But, in the laughing crowd he searched and found his father?s face
That steady look that said again, ?Get up and win the race.?
So, he jumped up to try again. Ten yards behind the last.
If I?m to gain those yards, he thought, I?ve got to run real fast.
Exceeding everything he had, he regained eight or ten,
But trying so hard to catch the lead, he slipped and fell again.
Defeat! He lay there silently, a tear dropped from his eye.
There?s no sense running anymore ? three strikes and I?m out ? why try?
The will to rise had disappeared, all hope had flew away.
So far behind, so error prone, closer all the way.
I?ve lost, so what?s the use, he thought, I?ll live with my disgrace.
But then he thought about his dad, who soon he?d have to face.
?Get up,? an echo sounded low. ?Get up and take your place.
You were not meant for failure here, get up and win the race.?
With borrowed will, ?Get up,? it said, ?You haven?t lost at all,
For winning is not more than this, to rise each time you fall.?
So up he rose to win once more. And with a new commit,
He resolved that win or lose, at least he wouldn?t quit.
So far behind the others now, the most he?d ever been.
Still he gave it all he had and ran as though to win.
Three times he?d fallen stumbling, three times he?d rose again.
Too far behind to hope to win, he still ran to the end.
They cheered the winning runner as he crossed first place.
Head high and proud and happy; no falling, no disgrace.
But when the fallen youngster crossed the line, last place,
The crowd gave him the greater cheer for finishing the race.
And even though he came in last, with head bowed low, unproud;
You would have thought he?d won the race, to listen to the crowd.
And to his Dad he sadly said, ?I didn?t do so well.?
?To me you won,? his father said, ?You rose each time you fell.?
And when things seemed dark and hard and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy ? helps me in my race.
For all of life is like that race, with ups and down and all,
And all you have to do to win ? is rise each time you fall.
?Quit!? ?GIVE UP, YOU?RE BEATEN.? They still shout in my face.
But another voice within me says, ?GET UP AND WIN THE RACE!?
?QUIT! GIVE UP! YOU?RE BEATEN!? They shout and plead,
There?s just too much against you now, this time you can?t succeed.

And as I start to hang my head

You would have thought he?d won the race,

And to his Dad he sadly said,

?To me you won,? his father said, ?You rose each time you fell.?

And when things seemed dark and hard 
and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy ? helps me in my race.

Haha should be fun. Plus we can hang out with Kinkade. 
I think 1025 but I'm not sure. Can you ask them how nothing is owed? That makes no sense. 
Yeah sounds good 
I just paid the 15 yesterday. So did you pay the 1000+ on mine or are we going to wait until it says we owe? 
Alrighty 
Thanks babe. 
Its 125 to fix the tv 
Hey dad we found a 42 inch plasma tv. It has no base so it would probably have to be mounted. Its 125 to fix the green color of the screen. Other than that it's a nice tv. Not sure if it's worth it and we probably can't put it up anywhere until we move what do you think? 
Yeah we got a free estimate from a tv repair place
Checked 4 other places and they charged 40-50 for an estimate 
Yeah found next to dumpster. 
Okay. Its pretty heavy for being so flat. I think it will be nice mounted though
He offered to store it in the attic. So maybe. 
Don't think it would fit in our room anywhere do you? 
Just found an hour long youtube video of that remix to sail. GG

Works great on the Asus transformer prime. It runs very smooth and the features are awesome. I love having the ability could set your own wallpaper though, instead of just having the default ones.  Edit: I also tested it out on my Nexus 4 and liked it as well. The more I use it the more I like it. There is room for improvement though. Just one example is that when you switch from landscape to portrait mode (or vise versa) the widgets don't flip the way one would expect. Keep up the good work though.

You will come back and be stronger. Don't lose your faith. God will be there for you. Randomly choose verses to read. It will help. Jeremiah is playing football now. He's pretty good. Jeremiah misses his sister too. I will forward my verses of the day that I think may encourage you. Love you.

I am so thankful to have Scherry in my life. She loves and supports me more than I deserve. 
You are not alone.. This past week has been a horrible one. I thought I could help by making Theresa act right
Then I find out she can only help herself and is just using me. I hurt you do bad and I don't mean too 
I am only nice because you've taught me about caring more for others than myself. I don't even argue with people anymore. 
At GFF Jeremiah said he wished you had taken him because I was mean because I told him not to hit my back
You are the nicest, sweetest person I've ever known 
I am not. I try in my heart to treat you the best way, but I continue to make the worst decisions and hurt you. I am so sorry
I love you so much. I want you to feel the way you make me feel inside. You make me feel loved, wanted and needed
My only fear is to let you down
cherrywithns@gmail.com
I've never done things for you because I was afraid. I have always thought of you as my partner and have tried to make you proud of me
I used to be totally self centered and cared only about what I wanted but your love and kindness has shown me a better way and my life is better for it
You deserve better than me. You are a queen, an angel, a great and loving person who doesn't deserve any pain. 
I try so hard to help Jeremiah be a good and loving person so he won't make the mistakes I've made

Oh... Not good. You couldn't just open up the case and fix it? 
Stupid warranty rules. Yeah I would have too... 
Well I'm just a bit biased in that... But I'd say android. Though I'm presuming you'd jailbreak on iPhone? 
As far as music goes on android Google play music has come a long way. And its super easy to switch from itunes. As far as cases and stuff it really depends on the phone. Mine is kinda hard to find stuff for but some like the samsung galaxys have almost as much as iphones. I will say this for iphones though. Group messaging and customer service. 
ff52d924175ef8faf90649927af87ca.flv
Some people have had success with it using apps to replace the stock messaging and on a few phones it works most of the time natively but on mine its pretty much a disaster. You might ask Demian how his works. Think of Google play like itunes. There's Google play music Google play store Google play books etc. Yeah or from the phone. I can stream my music or add remove apps from my phone on any computer with Internet. Just sign on to Google and its all there. 
Haha yeah there's a small problem. Once again I'm biased but I would say wait until the nexus 5 (the next version of mine) or whatever it's called is released and then decide. Historically that'll be this fall or early winter. The nexus line is nice because we get updates straight from Google instead of waiting months for oems to modify them. And prices for an unlocked no contract phone are much better. Also it depends on whether you like the skins that the manufacturers put on the phones. Though you could also put a custom rom on that'll do the same thing 
Oh and if you do decide to do a lot a customizing with it in the way of roms you can't mess a nexus up too bad unlike other phones. 
Haha sorry. Oems are original equipment manufacturers like samsung htc Motorola etc. Kinda. But not like I wanna run android 4.0 instead of 4.3. Its more like they add additional options that stock android or the skins don't have. 
Well you can't really do it next year either because the training is during the school year. But I looked at cal polys team and it seemed pretty easy to join. 
Katelynn found it at a job fair at the end of sophmore year and asked if I wanted to do it with her 
A ton of trainings and two searches. When I say a ton I think my training hours are close to 200 since last September 
Haha basically the idea is that you can survive out on your own with only the stuff in your pack for 24 hours. I don't think that's ever happened to a team though 
Just do it in college! 
You could get lost... Be sorta like doing it but the other way around

Ah okay. S3 maybe? I'm not a big fan of the ui but that's a matter of personal preference and you could change it. Or htc one
Ah okay. S3 maybe? I'm not a big fan of the ui but that's a matter of personal preference and you could change it. Or htc one 
It depends on how much you want to change. You can just change the homescreen with an app or you can unlock the bootloader and install a custom rom at which point you can customize almost anything 
verizon phone

For you I would say no since you have enough experience to change it without too much difficulty and there's good websites for that kind of stuff. xda developers is a good one 
A website for everything phone related more or less
I can almost always find an answer there and if not the Google plus android community probably knows 

Yeah. I rarely post but I read a fair amount of the articles off of the various communities

Ok won't bother u anymore. 
Yeah it was probably a pinched nerve, that shit will Fuck u up
Yeah but your sisters may have the wrong type of life insurance. Let me call them, if it ain't broke I won't fix it. But what if their policy don't work the way they think it does or if I can give them more coverage for the same price or the same coverage for cheaper. U never know I've seen so many horror stories, there are alot of fucked up insurance companies out there. 
What's good man how u been?
We also do investments too, so they may be interested in that

U right about that! 
What's up my boy, everything all good with u?
Don't know bro, I'm pretty much done with that illegal shit. 
LOL u will wear it or shit will get physical, u ain't bout that life! LOL 
That's a possibility. I got my kids now till maybe around that time. My mom may get them though. Let me know when u get off. 
But I'll holler at u, I still do know alot of people in my biz that burn that good. So maybe I can hook u up but I ain't dealing. My past ways got me where I'm at so I'm trying to stay disciplined in my new lane.

I know, that shit can be rough trust me I know. I have other challenges besides my kids and sometimes I feel like jumping off a bridge! LOL but just focus on the good because whatever u focus on grows whether it's negative or positive! 
If u ever need someone to talk to to cheer u up, I'm always here any time! 
It'll take some time but once u emotionally detach yourself from them and they know they ain't got you by the balls (so to speak), that basically they can't affect you anymore. All of a sudden shit magically changes. Either way it's a win win for u! And we've been split about 10 months. 
Yeah in due time... Yep she is
Like immediately after we split too, she is the type that has to be with someone to feel good about herself
At that point I didn't give a Fuck, its weird I'd have to explain it. U wanna talk?
I have a Google voice line that's different from my number, but he should see text messages too then right? 
I can see the numbers tested on my phone carrier, not the messages but just who they texted

It'll be like three four years after Rises that this is gonna come out so technically it's not that short of a time gap.

Knowing is half the battle. 

But something I've learned about android is there is no identical device. Each have a mind of its own. 

Is there something else I can do to give you more details?

That's the only bit I want. 
I was just wondering if it would still bake the same or if the apples baking with it somehow make it taste better. 
Yeah but does it change the crumble part in any way? I guess I'll just have to try it.

Best Clearomizers? 
I'm relatively new to vaping and am really enjoying it so far; I have an Ego C with a Viva Nova tank. 

I would like to get another clearomizer and was wondering what the consensus is on the best brand, size and resistance. Any other recommendations and insights are of course welcomed!

This is very nice indeed! I really like the Fleksy keyboard but unfortunately it doesn't support the German language. 
max

@fleksy This keyboard experience is amazing! Adding German is on 6th spot in your requests. How fast do you think this could be added?

@trade605 indeed. I really have no idea why it does that. Super annoying. 
@Teslief @insanj exactly. Worked fine on 6.0 but after upgrading to 6.1.2 they won't save.. Haven't found a way to fix this. 
So it's around 2pm. Hope that damn tweet about my battery won't pop up again. :/
@DEATHmeNEVER :D
Okay from now on I'll call you an ambulance 
@insanj always the same. Got that too often. -.-

"@ID_AA_Carmack: Heard in jest, but not a bad idea -- "garbage collection should be done when the user blinks"" mind = blown!
@bensge 's popoveractions is actually pretty cool :)
I'll have a look and tell you. Don't know at the moment. Last month was all about finals :D
It's in TPBottomBar's relock method and in dimscreen of SBAwayController (the latter for AndroidLock compatibility )
So this round of Counter Strike just started and BOOM Windows software update -.- 
That looks tremendous! Can't wait to see this on my springboard! Since I finished finals last Friday I started continued work on it today. Gonna do a more and more in the next couple of days. ;)

That is true. I don't believe we are needed at all. Part of what I was gonna discuss with them. 

Just pissed me off that they try to include or ask us for something like that with a two day notice. Not is it ok?? But we are doing this... Just pissed me off.

Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th. 
Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th, then have a cookout at our house on the 17th. This would give Masato a day to relax at home before flying to Tampa on the 18th in the morning. Additionally, Friday the 16th is "foodie friday" and all the food vendors have an item for 50% off that day. Can you come on the 16th? Alternatively, you can wander up for the cookout on the 17th? 
I will check the weather on Monday and decide with Masato. Of the 16th and 17th, one day will be a hangout day at our house and a cookout, and one will be a state fair day. Do you prefer one or the other?

Mehregan Apple Pie

8 large apples peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tbsp  lemon juice
2 tbsp  white sugar
1/3 cup  maple syrup
1/4 cup  brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp  cinnamon
1/2 tsp  ground ginger
1 1/2 tbsp  cornstarch
1/4 tsp  salt
milk

Persian ingredients:
dash of saffron
1 1/2 tsp cardamom
crushed pistachios


=== CRUST ===

1. Roll one batch of the pie pastry into a 13-inch circle and line a 9 1/2 inch
pie pan with it, letting the excess dough drape over the edge. Refrigerate the
pie shell while making the filling.


=== FILLING ===

1. Combine the apples, 3 tbsp of white sugar, and lemon juice. Mix well, then
set aside for 10 minutes to juice.

2. After 10 minutes, mix the remaining maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon,
ground ginger, cornstarch, and salt with the apples. Mix well.

To make it Persian, add a dash of saffron in step 1, and cardamom in an equal
amount to cinnamon in step 2.


=== BAKING ===

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Roll the remaining chilled pastry into an 11 inch
circle. Scrape the filling into the bottom pie shell and smooth with a spoon.

2. Lightly moisten the rim of the pie shell. Place the rolled dough over the top
of the filling and press the top and bottom shells together at the edge.

3. Trim the dough flush with the edge of the pan. Press on the rim with the
tines of a fork to make a crimped edge. With the fork, poke the top of the pie
crust several times to make steam vents. Brush the top of the pie lightly with
milk (for glaze) and sprinkle with sugar.

To make it Persian, sprinkle crushed pistachios on top.

4. Bake on the center oven rack for 30 minutes at 400F. Reduce the heat to 375F
and rotate the pie 180 degrees. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes more, until any
visible juices bubble thickly. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool at least
2 hours before serving.

COMMENT BY USER eatmedetroit:
I have used this recipe twice-excellent. Read carefully, I have been to
23 countries. This is how I modified: No meat--too greasy. No garlic--not needed.
No sugar--use aged vinegar, nice and sweet. I also added one cube chicken
boullion and one can of chicken stock, no fat. Also HALF the tomato paste.
FRESH dill--lots. Cooked onions in grape seed oil, high burn rate. If you follow
what I suggest, you will achive culinary greatness and Ukrainian authenticity.

Cranberry Shortbread Cookies
* modified from joyofbaking.com/shortbreads/RaisinShortbreads.html

1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups cranberries
1/2 cup nuts (any kind)
bit of cinnamon
bit of cardamom
1 large egg, lightly beaten


1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter/oil a cookie sheet.

2. Beat the butter and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Add the sugar
and beat until light and fluffy.

3. In a separate bowl whisk the flour with the salt. Add the flour mixture to
the butter mixture and beat until the dough just comes together. If the dough is
too dry, add a small amount of soft butter and milk.

4. Split the dough roughly in half. Spread half of the dough over the bottom of
the prepared sheet, and gently press the dough to form an even layer. Sprinkle
the cranberries and nuts over the dough, and gently press them into the dough.
Sprinkle cinnamon and cardamom evenly over the layer, to taste.

5. Mix the remaining half of the dough until it is crumbly, and sprinkle the
crumbles even over the layer. Gently press the crumbles down for stability.

6. Take the lightly beaten egg and, using a pastry brush, coat the top of the
shortbread with the egg wash. Then, with the tines of a fork, slowly drag the
fork back and forth across the shortbread to make a decorative pattern.

7. Bake the shortbread at 350F for about 30 - 40 minutes or until light golden
brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

I don't follow. Alternative medicine is already a huge market, probably because it already is not prescription. Anyone is free to buy alternative medicine from whoever produces it. 

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition.

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition. You'd go to the doctor to get diagnosed, and the doctor would tell you what drugs to get. It's no different than going to a mechanic to get your car problems diagnosed. But you don't need a prescription to get parts for your car. And most people have a mechanic they trust, just like they have a doctor they trust. 
You're already getting commercials for snake-oil erectile dysfunction "medicine" (which is not FDA-approved and often not even safe). So what harm would it be to have commercials for real erection dysfunction drugs that actually work and aren't tainted with lead?

One of my brothers friends is a conservation officer. Some of those pot growths are booby-trapped to hell. If I was OP, I'd report that to someone and stay away from that area. 
Depends on location. We have one acre in our backyard with some tiny woods. If you live in the countryside with lots of acres, you might have more woods.

How many impoverished immigrant parents are horribly educated, can barely speak English, but invest a huge amount of time and effort making sure their kids grow up with better opportunities than they did? A lot. 

The first thing someone notices about you is your appearance--how you dress, your mannerisms, how you carry yourself. The second thing they notice is what comes out as soon as you open your mouth.

If you screw either one of those things up from the beginning, people aren't going to take you seriously; they're going to make a conclusion about who you are by those first moments. 

First impressions are important. How you speak is part of it. 
I've never seen an outhouse in Tennessee, but I have seen bathrooms of such poor quality and sanitation at rural gas stations that I'd have rather used an outhouse or a port-o-potty. 

By the way, I believe the majority of Alaskans actually do use outhouses.

Ah. There'd very little the kid can do. I thought you were suggesting that it's not unreasonable that impoverished, uneducated parents can't raise a child out of the poverty cycle because they, themselves, were raised poorly. 

If you're a kid born to crap parents, there's not much you can do other than just to do your best. But if you have kids of your own, there's no reason that they have to be raised in the same way.

I think police would find that of they acted with reasonable force 
If more cops acted this way, people would trust them more. If people trusted them more, they'd also cooperate more. If people trusted and cooperated with police, the police would have much less reason to feel threatened by the public, and they'd probably find that their job even becomes safer.

Arab countries have done this numerous times before in Israel's short history, and Israel has come out on top every time. Israel has an extremely competent and strong military, and it is precisely because of this strength that the United States even started to ally with them as a Middle-Eastern counter to the Soviet Union. Israel is, today, militarily stronger than ever before in history. The Arab nations will not go to war for Palestine, *again*, because they will not win that war, *again*. And if they use terrorism as a way to perpetually harass the Israeli population, they'll find themselves on the receiving end of Israeli air strikes. 
Nuclear weapons are almost strategically worthless. Israel will not use nuclear weapons. Neither will Iran, for that matter.

I really have no idea what either side really hopes to accomplish.

Palestine is as much of a mess, with basically several governments and a complete refusal to accept Israel's existence. Not only does Israel exist, it exists so much that it's occupied you for decades and can basically unilaterally decide your fate! It also refuses to renounce violence, even though Palestinian terror is the primary excuse Israel uses to justify its actions, and even though a pacifist Palestine would undeniably be on the moral high ground, almost assuring better international support.

On top of all of this, both sides seem to most agree on a two state solution, but that's a mess, too. How can you live in such a small area with so many locked-down borders? How can business get done? And Palestine is so incredibly small, how can it succeed as a country? The Gaza Strip is smaller than most sponsors in America, and the West Bank is smaller than even a moderately-sized American metro area.

A real liquor store is going to have a phenomenal liquor selection compared to Wal-Mart, as well. If you're in West Lafayette, you can probably just Google "best beer selection purdue," or something of that nature. You should be able to buy beer no problem. I have Chinese friends who use their passports to buy beer in Tennessee. It's just a matter of that you met an idiot cashier at Wal-Mart. If it happens again, you can ask to see the manager. 

A note about alcohol in Indiana, however. When you're transporting a closed container (e.g., case of beer), make sure it's out of reach of the driver. When you're transporting an open container (like a bottle of whiskey to a friend's house), put it in the trunk. Also, you can't buy beer at stores on Sundays, but you can order it from restaurants. These laws are unique to Indiana, but almost every state has their own convoluted alcohol laws.

Sifting your penny containers 
I noticed your post, and I have an idea about how to separate your pennies from the rice and beans. 

Ever had a lego box as a kid? Did you notice that all the small pieces ended up in the bottom? That's because when agitated, container contents tend to sort themselves by particle size. 

I'd dump all of your rice and beans and pennies into a larger container, then shake it up violently. With luck, the rice will go to the bottom, and the beans or pennies will end up on top. Either way, it'll be fairly well-sorted, and you should have no problem removing the pennies.

With regard to Simon Belmont, imagine a Castlevania stage! Its awesome.

With regard to Goemon, he's the perfect kind of character for Smash Bros--strong Nintendo background, over the top comedy, and a host of weapons. He'd use his pipe as a weapon, and he'd also be able to throw coins and bombs. One of his moves would be his chain pipe. Also, imagine an Edo castle stage! Spectacular. But best of all is his final smash. Impact!! Goemon would whip out his conch shell and summon Impact. He'd leave the screen, and as Impact you could use youth left hand punch, right hand pipe smash, or coin nasal bullets. And, of course, that iconic and silly Impact music would play the whole time

Katie, 

Ostensibly, the HAIMS deployment at Lackland is supposed to start in a little over a month. I have not received invites to any PIM calls. Does this mean that the training dates might be getting pushed? 

Also, has there been any word, yet, on the rescheduling of Dover or Edwards? 

Thanks,

So Ramsey has to knock them off their high horses before he can teach them how to fix the little things they've been doing wrong, probably for years, so they can reach that "next level" of being a chef.

I worked under a graduate student one summer as her "field research assistant", in the course of things, the professor she was working under came out to check on the project. The grad student gave a glowing review of my work. 

When I returned to the university that fall, I visited the professor during her office hours and asked straight out of she knew of any professors or grad students looking for an assistant/intern, preferably in my field of choice (marine biology; the professor taught/researched general botany). She offered to put me in touch with one of two professors who ran marine biology labs. I chose the one that most piqued my interest, and got a job in a marine ecology lab. I still kind of regret taking that job over one working in a lab that focused on sea turtle research, but that's neither here nor there. 

All that to say, schedule an appointment or go see the professor during open office hours (if they have any) and ask. Maybe be prepared to offer a few references and/or a CV if the professor asks for them?

So much this. 

I went to a show once. It was my first time seeing my favorite band perform live. It was also my only time seeing them perform live; this was their farewell show. 

So when the time came for them to perform my favorite song, I pulled out my phone to record a video. I knew it'd look crappy. I knew it'd sound crappy. I didn't care. I just wanted to be able to relive the show, and the video would suffice. But someone went out of their way to make sure that I knew they were scoffing and rolling their eyes at me in the dark, noisy, crowded club-venue. 

I chose to take that video (and not punch the jerkwad in the face) because I don't really form "visual" memories. When I try to recall things, it's like reading text off of a page. So I snap photos and videos of things I want to recall visually, like the light show at the concert or the way the band interacted with each other and the crowd. 

That doesn't mean I was any less invested in the experience or that I somehow wasn't really experiencing it. It just means I was recording it for posterity while I was experiencing it.

A man with OCD recites a poem about his one true love. It?s heartbreaking.


To everyone who ever said ?I have OCD? just because they?re organized, tidy, super clean, meticulous?this is what OCD looks like.

How about we stop using that term so lightly.


This is a very good poem, and it?s a very good example of what OCD is actually like, rather than the weird pop culture concept that?s arisen in the last two decades or so.

But, speaking from my perspective as [metaphorically] the person he?s talking about, the one who was the ?one true love? of someone with a severe mental illness, ?You owe me love because it?s the only thing keeping me from falling apart? is one of one of the most unhealthy, destructive, and abusive things that will keep you enmeshed longer than just about anything else. Especially when you?re 14 when it starts. Especially when you?re developmentally disabled AND mentally ill. Especially when everyone tells you *you* are the REAL ?crazy one? in the relationship, and that you?re lucky to have anyone willing to put up with you.

This narrative isn?t extricable from society, or who is considered entitled to time, care, consideration, love, and patience, and who is considered the PROVIDER of these things, rather than the recipient.

It?s all well and good to applaud a realistic description of OCD from someone who actually has it, but this entire poem is shitting all over another person?s autonomy to say what she will and will not have in her life.

The reasons he was given are valid reasons.

Staying with someone because they think being with you ?fixes them? is, in fact, a mistake.

"How could she leave me when she owes me so much? is never going to go over with me. It?s the same old song with different lyrics.


He says he can?t understand how their love is now a ?mistake? in her eyes. And I really don?t get an abusive vibe from this as the way he feels is pretty normal for anyone who has their love end. Plus, at the end he actually reveals that his pain over her is ironically helping him to undone some of his rituals - he leaves on the light and doesn?t lock the door. These were things he felt bound to do repeatedly, so perhaps after her he will be able to become less OCD through his love for her, even if they never are together again. I think it turned out really beatifully.


I?ll have to dig around for a link to the post, but a blogger by the name of josiahd posted (maybe reblogged, I can?t recall exactly) something about how abusive people aren?t incapable of loving their abusee, aren?t incapable of wanting ?what?s best? for their abusee, can honestly and absolutely love their abusee and still be abusive, intentional or otherwise.

The culture of the conference - I felt incredibly at home there with such a focus in this subculture . Schedule was great and manageable -- never felt like I was struggling through the sessions. The choice of speakers were great. Main sessions were total winners as well, really hitting on areas I encounter. There really seemed to be a consistent theme of the battle of the mind. Conference staff and servants were amazing -- really felt like I was apart of the experience with them instead of just being an observer. Having Pastor Matt Chandler was a perfect session to end the conference.

Greetings! Sorry about Saturday. We had a missions night after service. It was awesome! But I'm sure I also missed a whole bucket of awesome with you guys too. 

Hey really quick. We are having our equip and inspire conference from August 13th to 15th. You should come! And anyone else in your church that is interested. Its a personal and ministry development conference. Also, I'm working with Studio Red to develop one of our breakouts which is focused on visual story telling through film.. And all of life. If you or anyone else is interested... Let me know! 
Tish
Good morning! Hope you are well with the house cleaning up and stuff. Quick question.. Do we need to feed the miniature fish anything? 
Doug
Hey Uncle Doug. Welcome back! A few questions : 

Could we get the keys for the garage door and the back door? 

We noticed there's a grill in the front yard. Are you guys planning to take that up? 

The fan in Marisa's former room is wobbling at certain speeds. Are we allowed to attempt to balance it? 

And finally, is there anything we can arrange and help you guys out with your move? At your new house and here? 
Got it. No keys necessary in that case. I'll ask the guys if they each want individual alarm and door codes. 

Cool, I'll take a look at the fan. 

I'll check with the others about the yard. I'll let you know if anyone is up for it. I'll gladly help out. When were you thinking?

Got it, and will do. Thanks!

Hey pastor charlton. 
Found a broken-off screw head in the spigot, was blocking the stem from going down. Not sure if there should be concern on how a broken screw-head ended up in there, but water's all good now. 

Yeah. I couldn't visibly see where it might have broken off of, but I left it on top of the hose box if you want to look at it.

Wow, thanks for doing that! Is okay for us to retrieve it via a hard drive? Or if you could

Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago.

If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society.
Where are you

Haha okay

Is this chando
Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Afif Mulla <afifmulla@gmail.com>, 
Most of us have been in a situation where they have found themselves wanting more with a friend, physically of course. For me it was my best friend which morphed nicely into a full blown relationship. 


Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago. Industries like porn are booming, sex toys are slowly becoming something of a normal shopping experience. Sex is no longer a taboo subject area. 


So with all that taken into consideration its becoming a lot easier for friends to become friends that fuck. But does it last? Is it really that easy and emotionless? Or will someone end up getting hurt? 


How to get into that situation? 


Well unlike a relationship there is no commitment, you think just sex would be appealing to anyone, you're wrong. Some people know they are full of emotion and therefore it wouldn't work for them. Others feel that they could do it, but they probably will get attached and finally they are well up for it. 


Don't be mistaken into thinking someone who agrees to this situation immediately is the wrong choice. After all, they only want what you want emotionless sex. 


Unlike relationships asking someone shouldn't be a task, it shouldn't feel like a big deal, you'd be choosing a friend you wanted to have sex with already and if the situation is female to male I bet most males would jump at the chance. 


Is it 'slaggy'? 


Well of course you're a whore male or female, after all, you want your friend plowing you or allowing you to plow them, over no stronger attraction than just friends. 


If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society. 


Will this stay as sex for both parties? 


Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Hi Aunty Angela, 
Hi Aunty Angela, how are you today? It was so much great fun being with you on both Wednesday and Thursday nights! Thanks heaps again for the DVD stand! I love it, I even attached a photo of it with my DVDs in to show you! In regards to the movie we're going to see, Mum says we can go to the one at 12:15 tomorrow if you like? 
Yep! Cool! Mum says that's fine. I'm looking forward to tomorrow already! Thanks, glad you like how I got it set up! The bottom two rows are just CD box sets that I thought would look great there!

The second one wasn't about a fat guy but yes same idea. 
Indeed. What I was talking about comes more into play when someone wants to lose "trouble fat" aka that last sliver of fat that makes your abs stay concealed. 

Obviously people with an obesity problem need to straight up cut calories. I'm just saying other factors influence how quickly you can lose weight especially if you're body is well maintained. 
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, 
Should I overclock in a m-itx build (such as the Prodigy)? Because it seems like everything would overheat in such a small and confined space, but maybe I'm wrong (probably). Also, even if I don't overclock should I get the 4670k over the 4670 due to it being better or something? Or just go with the 4670? Also,c what's the best m-itx board for the 4670? One more question I have is, if I do overclock a 4670k in a m-itx build, should I use a closed loop cooler such as the H50 or will an aftermarket heatsink be enough? Thanks guys.
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, if you want a CLC, you might as well go for a bigger one like an h100i or else air coolers will work equally well for less noise. The Phanteks tc-12dx is a great cpu cooler. 
White cases are sexy. We need more good monitors in white to match them. 
If someone isn't saving money, they could still get a z87 with a locked processor for the extra features.

Par for the course with Google though. 
I also believe Xperia ZR uses that SoC as well. 
I don't want bigger batteries as much as I want good battery life. Unlike a lot of people here, a compact and thin phone is in fact desirable in my eyes. I won't buy a phone thicker than 10mm and bigger batteries also means longer charge times. 

Technically, we need new battery tech that has greater energy density. 

Also, battery life is like the one thing moto does well with its phones. 
Sounds like the moto x. I feel like they really missed the mark on price. 
A shitty one at that. 
I bought a 120GB ipod and threw my entire music collection on it. Then I realized I got skip syndrome because of that. Returned it and got an 8GB Sandisk and an mSD card and reorganized songs into playlists. Life is better now. 

Personally I just want 32GB on my phone. 





What is this nonsense? How am I supposed so how what is going on? 
Yikes. 
I still do. 
I still do. It is only on Monday. 
Really. I mean I would probably have to get to your house by five thirty but still

We have very few assault rifles as it costs so much in taxes and takes months for the paper work to clear. We have plenty of civilian rifles like the ar15 platform and other semiauto rifles though.

That and wouldn't those with said rifles be more likely to an apocalypse

I see how it is! Must be a bitch to find wallpapers for 3 monitors at those sizes too. I find dual screens annoying enough 
Dang I am so jealous. I am trying to customize my phone and not having any experience in digital art is probably the biggest set back, I forge on though thanks to the interwebs and such. 

Great now all I am going to dream about is triple monitors all the way across my desk!

Yeah I am sure you showed it to me. I can see the weird way they draw the main guys eyes they are like circles and the girl has long blond hair and is known for being like a strategist but it seems like she sucks for the longest time. And then at one point her hair gets cut off and she kinda shows her true nature of planning.

No, I got the screw on top. I actually found it at TJ Maxx. Works perfectly fine for me. Its pretty sturdy. The green plastic is thick and hard, but it feels like the brittle type. It'd take a lot to break it, but I don't think breaking the handle would be out of the question of you dropped it from a fair height onto solid concrete. Its not Nalgene sturdy, but I can't imagine breaking it in any kind of ordinary way. 

Also, sometimes water can get in between the wood and the glass. There are air holes in the plastic on the bottom of the bottle to mitigate this, but if you get the wood soaking wet, you'll just have to take the pieces apart and let them dry individually.

Frankly, if they used rubberized plastics and rubber instead of the hard plastic and bamboo, this thing would be indestructible and totally awesome. That's probably go against their "green" bottle mantra, though.

Hello, I'm Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat on his brow? No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor. No says the man in The Vatican, it belongs to God. No, says the man in Moscow, it belongs to everyone. I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose, Rapture. 


That was from memory. And I started playing BioShock less than two weeks ago. I just really love that speech. 


Also, as someone who has obviously played the first BioShock, if I just reached Heapheastos, how long do I have until I reach the end? Please don't spoil anything, I already know too much.

Cavity 

Dentist 

Tooth care 

Do you guys think this is a cavity?

Hello, 
A few questions about my teeth. 
Hello, I am here to ask a few questions about my teeth. 


First of all, some background. I am a thirteen year old male who has had braces. I still have wires behind some of my teeth in the front. I generally do a good at brushing my teeth, and have started flossing nightly after my last visit to the dentist. I have never had a cavity. 


Alright, time for some questions. 


Does [this] (http://imgur.com/H5Jc6PN) appear to be a cavity? I would find this very odd for I do not eat sweets and have always done a pretty good job at keeping my teeth clean. I also saw the dentist less than a week ago and she said that screening looked good, but I should floss to make sure my gums stay healthy. 


If it were to be a cavity, how would I go about getting rid of it? I really don't want to to have it drilled and filled, for it is only a tiny brown spot on the tooth. 


Are there natural ways to get rid of cavities? I ask because I have seen many articles about this. 


If the picture I have supplied does not give a good enough view, I can try to get a better one. 


Thank you for any answers you give.

No, I noticed it about two days after seeing the dentist. Also, a quick question. How serious is tooth decay? I've heard it can be fixed relatively easily.

Would you eat the bark or rub it on the tooth? I've also heard that cod liver oil can completely fix cavities. Have you heard anything about that? Do you think it could fix tooth decay too?

It just needs time. Elon Musk said it takes 4 generations for a product to become mainstream. 
But those phones are on contract. You are stuck paying 70 to 100 dollars a month for 2 years. With this you pay $300 and never have to pay again. 
Buying a Nexus phone solves this. It's only $300 unlocked.

If you are planning on gaming, you will want a graphics card. If you can raise your budget to $1000, you can add a GTX 760. This is one of the best price to performance cards. You can run Crysis 3 on high/max with this card. 


TL;DR: If you don't get a graphics card, this will run nothing but minesweeper and Half Life 1.

I went with the FX 8350 for the 8 cores. My logic is since the next generation consoles use 8 core chips, many more games will be optimized to use them. This, if I am correct, will result in big performance increases in games. The motherboard was chosen for a reason. I plan on slowly upgrading this PC, starting with adding a hard drive. I want to be able to add a CPU fan for overclocking, more memory, and a second graphics card at a later point. This motherboard will allow me to do these things. The thing that worries me about the AMD cards is their age. Some of them have been around for a long time.
I'll admit the ram is somewhat expensive, but $30 for a power supply is not at all overpriced.

I think love feels like those times when you wanted to give up but then you can't allow yourself to do so. Like ugh you want to give up soooo bad because you know that you would be better without but no some how you're still there. Like those movies where in the scene the character is reaching out to something that he can almost grasp but not quite like its almost there but no.

Walk Past me

As I sit here hardened by the cold breath of the wind I consider ending it all. I look down, two pound eighty three, barely enough to buy a hot meal. How did my life come to this. My dog cries a lonesome whimper, poor thing. He has barely eaten all week, he must be starved. I reach over and give him a pat, considering who needs fed more. A man walks past shaking his head. I look up to him, almost pleading, but all he does it tut. Does nobody understand? I think this could be the night, what is there to keep going for?
I study the sky. It must be about seven, soon the train will arrive from down south and I will be ignored by tourists and natives alike. I stand up, gather my belongings, my daily living allowance and attach the dog to a rope that doubles as a belt and go to the newsagents just down the street. One tin of dog food, a bag of crisps and the cheapest bottle of water in the store and I'm left with seven pence to start off tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow.
I walk back up to my lamp post, its flickering on now. I slump back down but don't plan on staying long, soon drunks will fill these streets and I don't want to be in that situation again. I find an old chip box lying on the pavement. I rip it open and spill the dog food into it. Its funny, this used to look disgusting, now it looks like a delicacy. I leave my best friend to tuck in while I eat my crisps.
A young boy passing by with his mother, loosens his grip of her hand and begins to run over to me. My eyes light up. He reminds me of my son. Before he can get too close his mother draws him back in line, followed by a lecture of staying with mum and not to talk to strangers. She speaks as if I'm some sort of monster, an alien scum. If only she would take the time to find out my story, all I want is for someone to listen.
Ever since I lost my job my life has been on a downward slope. When I was made redundant and I couldn't afford for my family I started falling into depression. My wife and I started arguing over everything and bills began to mount up. Eventually she divorced me. She took everything, my house, my car, my only son. The only thing she left me was the dog. I was left homeless and heartbroken. The depression only got worse.
Even after all this time I've never went off the rails, never hit the bottle. Never touched a drug. I've tried to pick my life back up but once you're passed rock bottom there's no coming back. I've considered suicide many times over these last few months on the streets, but I feel tonight is my final night.
I get up. Staring at the rope keeping my dog by my side. It's getting dark, I better find a bed for the night. Tucking my cover under my arm I grab the dog rope and begin to walk down the dimly lit street, towards the local park where my son and I used to play, before it was embarrassing to be seen with your dad.
The path to the park passes by my old house. I stop just outside. Looking up to my sons room, the curtains arse drawn over but I can see lights flickering sand changing behind them. He must be playing on his Xbox, he was never off the thing. The car is not in the drive, my ex-wife must be on her way home from work by now.
I consider going up to the door and seeing my son, he is 14 after all, he understands why I'm not there. But then again he might just get angry at me and I don't want that. I reach down into my pocket, my mind and heart begin to race. I pull out a note I wrote a little while back. My hands shaking I study the note in my hand. Tonight is definitely the night.
I attach the note to my dogs collar and walk up to the door. I take in one last deep breath considering my whole life. It all rests on this one final act. I take the rope off the dogs collar and I knock the door before making a quick dash for it. It will take a moment for my son to answer.
I hurry down the stairs after pausing my game of call of Duty and and answer the door. Instantly my old dog bounds up on me. This is odd, the first thing I notice is a letter tied to his collar.
'Dear son, by the time you read this it may already be too late. I just want you to know I will always be our memories together when we went out. This is nothing to do with you or mum. My life has gotten to low and I just can't pick it up. I will forever love you. This is not your fault. Love dad.'
I stand there numb. Dread setting in, without even grabbing my keys, I put the dog on the old leash that we still kept by the door and ran to find my dad. I had to stop him before he took his life. As I'm running I stop to consider where he might be. I re-read the note, 'I will always be with our memories together of when we went out.' It takes me a minute but I somehow feel this line is significant. Then it dawns on me. The old park down by the quarry where he took me to play football! Its about 10 minutes from the house. I begin to leg it to the park.
Finally, as I draw my last few breaths, I set up the rope on a tree branch high enough from the ground that I will not reach the floor. I think back through my life and what it has become. I begin to well up, tears in my eyes. I look over to my left. I can see the old goal posts me and my son would play football on. I was always in goals and I made a promise to him to come here every weekend and share time with him. This is the only place I still feel truly happy, even if the memories make me feel sad. I climb up the tree a little until I can put my head through the rope. 3...2...1...
"DAD!"

Yeah but my comments may have been a little different if I'd known ;) I'm happy to be mostly positive. I think it's a good step forward with it. That's true a good offline task can be handy. Looks a good list tbh and I hope your flight goes well.

Hey Karen, dad says you don't want fajitas on Monday. That's cool, Nats will just get stuff for mum and dad plus her. You still want to do the BBQ? We have sausage but if you could get the burgers, barms and finger rolls. We'll get the BBQ this weekend I think. See you on Monday 
Yeah that's OK. Thought you would get it there. Yes we realise that but it will be ok in a cool box, don't think it will be that hot. 
Hey Richard. How are you doing? Just noticed you're at Patton Air. Went for an interview there earlier this year. If anything comes up I'd be interested at getting another crack at an interview. Just so you know I'm CIPS qualified now. 

Hope things are going well for you.

Some pianist at ud, she insists I bone you because newark (de) sucks

Without space to toss and turn, I go strait to sleep :)
I only saw one gecko when I was+there, lots of anoles though
I assume the wildlife is regional, and they'd have a lot of competition for food, so it wouldn't shock me. The anoles you can wear as earings, because they'll clamp down and not let go :)

When's your party? I'll probably be late, but I'll get the us there early 
Pa
Ok, I was gonna mention the show was moved to super late, but I'm still into happy hour. I'll focus on being extra drakee tomarrow
Till be there? 
I don't mind either of those things :)
I'm going to be there, I've been working nights :(
My beard is at ultimate gross stage, cuz I'm growing it (though I suppose you saw that Saturday), also, haven't drank some Sunday, yay
You? 
Cuz they don't know you failed at shower :)
Also, pops is playing at the riverfront tonight, a female friend will probably be there
No, shirly
Weren't you all I want to have female friends I envy you? She's about as single as I am
Sara? 
I couldn't handle that
My lie about mere poking
I'll Prolly be lingering in the area all evening
Oh, yeah, that's how I'd do it... 
Yep, on the river
Pretty sure one getting oysters, then I'll probably linger to iron hill
Sarahs doing happy hour, but gonna cut out early, I think Scali said fuck ten o'clock, Jon may be coming out
Anyway, you can try your magic of you want. I am pretty sure she gives everyone a date no matter what, I can't determine how she decides who to date again and fuck 
Yeah, me too, I'm Prolly getting drunk in the parking lot
Now she's hedging on coming out
You coming out tonight? 
Ok, whatever you feel like
Yes, thanks. 
Are you bringing people? Pops wants people if you know any, the late night fucked them 
Huh ?
It's so late :)

I'm home safe, let me know when you are lady. Thanks so much for coming out, hope you had fun
I will
You too 
Sweet dreams when the time comes, and good times until 
Ps, tell James he's a Cunt for not coming 
Even with a crooked face? 
So she's said to me
I'm so drunk, hope this drawing works
I'm home, she's at her boys, and she already said you liked her
Also said a 60 percent chance she shows on Saturday separate from me, but she won't bump Molly so... 
Huh? 
She said you smell bad, I assume you're out
Shirley griffens I think
Thinks what? 
Fucking pink shirt didn't believe we weren't when Shirley was trying to wing man it for me
She was like you have a girlfriend here, I was like huh, and she was like that bitch rubbing on me, and I was like in single, she was like oh, that game 
Yeah, that boy was a frined apperwnkry 
Like Shirley and I... 
I've never heard of a parent being accused of abuse for spanking unless they were the type to do kindly the time to the point that they were hiding actual abuse under the guise of legit punishment 
You're such a good wing man, and apparently a total cock block
Yeah, it was still funny
I feel great 
Perfect amount of hangover to feel like rebirt
H
He's a good guy
She told me off for saying I was single in front of my girlfriend hahahahaha
But you were literally right there in the conversation. 
No way I could lie like that, I lie through ommission and obfuscation, not to the face
Well it's lunch time it's gotta be close, if it's like happy hour, whatever
Omg, epic awkward couple photo

They DO NOT like each other
Which zoo? 
Bring your tiger poking stick
They have otters
And an awesome bird
Who did? 
They DO NOT like each other
I didn't get close enough
It must be nice to be a girl, you get to rub on everyone and no one cares
Yeah, such an awesome super power
I face booked you the photo
Did we (I) not look like hell this time for the spark photo? Maybe we'll be in it
No, it's tall and colour full, and we looked each other in the eyes and paced together
Scottlan
I'd murder babies for the super power of welcome rubbing
You know it's true, I have no morals and like to rub...

I really like human contact
It's true
Pretty sure, ps, that may mean the bird collection is gone from the zoo
No, they were sitting bored

The party tomarry? 
Don't know, Prolly nine or ten, wanna brunch? 
You know I love you, but if anything I encourage or watch bad decisions, I am not one to count on to look after, it goes against everything I believe in
It'd make me sad if you whined about it afterwards. So don't do anything you'll regret if you come please
I don't babysit out of love, not terribleness
That's not true, I hate it at times
I don't feel it's my place to control other people

You were totally anti that a week ago, but sure
I enjoy BEING a shit show, watching people I care about being one makes me sad

Heathers house is 1202 painters crossing chadds ford pa 19317, Jaime says you should pick her up and give her a call with ample warning that you're coming, if possible, and assuming you're still in newark

But as it is, it just sucks
But as long as you're boning me, I won't gripe if people at bars avoid fucking me

No, just the one time I slept there, and that wasn't rubbing, just one long grope
Really? So much playful prancing
Odd
When I slept there, absolutly not
I am not concious of the constant rubbing, so who knows
How's your sister? 
They're still driving from nc, I'm picking her up like 330
Good. You were totally chill about it, but it stressed me
Jon was like are you serious, why do people think you're dating? I really was unawarw

Apparently whenever I'm drunk I strait up rub her constantly without really even noticing
Yeah, you're the one that told. I probably should apologize and not drink as much around her

To sleep on
Overnight with Ava at heatgers 
And catch up with Jaime and amanda
Yeah, it was an overnight 
Ava had an overnight at her best friends house
She's staying tonight too
And amandas daughter was a friend 
And Amanda and Jaime and I had things to talk about. Emotions and such
You didn't used to do overnights? 
You mis estimate the role Jaime, Amanda, or I played in her life then 
She begged for staying and didn't want people to start leaving 
Huh? 
I'd be shocked if a bottle of wine was consumed between the four adults 
Yeah, I got ya. But it wasn't

I do adult sleepovers all the time. Because I'll talk until I'm passing out from exhaustion. Booze and sex not required :)
On couches
Cuz I run a high risk of spoon molesting... 
Well, I was basically avas step father. And jadyn did at least a dozen overnights at my place. Bella (amandas kid) was morbidly curious about me
I'm actually really good with kids because I treat them like people
Hahahaha, if you came they'd try to suck you in too. 
Bella didn't remember me at all, but thought I was avas dad. So she was cool with me
Tired is a necessity 
Hahahahaha, I know. 
Maybe adult sleepovers are a single parent thing? Because they were common from when I was little toi
So glad it stayed here. We are destroying it :)
Nope
