Qualifying to be my wife lol. 

Haha I wouldn't say it's a big problem. 
You hush! 

Maybe 

Definitely! But I think there are ways around it. Having someone 
live with you makes things a lot easier. But find an apartment that has utilities already paid for. Buy a car outright for like 2,000 so you won't have to make payments. Get straight talk (pay $45 a month). Cable tv is a big no no (just get a fast Internet plan for like $60). So in total, if you figure in the monthly bills, your part would be like $400-500 a month. That's not bad. You

Lol that's true. 

Why are you afraid you won't graduate, you obviously do want to graduate. Some people don't even care about if they graduate, they have no ambition to do bigger and better things with their lives. You want something better with your life, remember you told me you wanted to live comfortably with your future family. You won't be able to do that living off minimum wage with no high school degree. So make that scenario your motivation to get things done! Because if you don't, you know the repercussions. Life is all about working hard and getting what you want, as long as you WANT IT, you'll get it! And if that doesn't motivate you then I'll help you stay on task!!! Haha

C
Check out this job offer I literally just got 
I seriously wish I could help you. 
Transfer to a school in Chicago. You can come live with me. 
Don't. 
You don't have that much time as it is and you'll become so attached. 
No. I just know you got too big of a heart and I don't want you to stretch yourself way too thin. 
Seriously, slow the fuck down. 
Then go volunteer somewhere. 
I'm anxious to hear back from my new job. 
No clue. I'm still waiting for the official job offer. They had to do a background check. 
I'll pay for it. You can pay me back in kisses. 
But I did the w4 did the i9 and my background check passed at the other job.

Oh trust me, I'm very simple. :p
I always eat out
I'm not a trucker. I'd be dispatch. I put in enough time behind the wheel that I earned that position though. 
I'm not allowed to cook. 
Yeah I'm always right. 
My mom is a control freak so the kitchen is off limits. 
They have literally forbid me from getting a motorcycle and don't want me to move out. 
Not at all. They just want to control me.

Question. 
Could you date someone who's never done anything with a female? 
Lmao

Why not? 
Like never been kissed. 
I've dated a few never been kissed. They are so awkward. 
Really? You wouldn't date someone who's touched a dude? 
Yup totally pure. 
Really what? I'm not talking about me if that's what your asking. 
Would I what? 
Why not? 
Yeah everyone I've ever dated who's never been kissed has that home schooled awkwardness 
Why not? 
You are the only one to say yeah. 
Yeah. Never been on a date either.

Because you're gorgeous. 
I haven't lied to you since I've met you, I'm not going to start now.

Nothing. I'm perfect in every single way. 
Do you own a bicycle? 
Well then we have a few options. We can either take the train or find a way to cram two bikes in my car. 
Don't worry they insult themselves. 
Well I just realized, to get to the train, we'll have to stuff them in my car anyways. I'm a bit slow lol.

Hey you what's going on? 
Watching gundam style for some reason. 
Serious question for you. 
Why do I keep dating people younger than me? Is it because I'm immature or because I have a better connection with the younger crowd. 
You know that song is at 1. 7 billion views now? 
Why do I keep finding myself liking younger girls? 
Are you talking sex or life? 
So are you. Don't judge me. Btw I can get you into the museum of science and industry for free. I've been a member since 2007
Hey you. What's going on? 
Why do you say that? 
You made me think of something.

Any rationale as to why or just a personal issue with it. Seems rather odd since this tends to form a cornerstone of most career thinking these days tying personal goals to company goals and direction as well as how to develop yourself in the context of your own personal style and skills. Learning seems to think everyone can be trained into a particular style as opposed to leveraging their personal style.

S4 doesn't have an spen... S3 is better than iPhone 5. S4 just humiliates it. The iPhone looks nice and its metal. But it scratches easily and you can get dents. The s4 is plastic but it's more likely to survive a fall. The iPhone is super simple. But by being simple it limits what you can do with it. The s4 or really any android phone is YOUR phone. If you want your favourite song as a ringtone... No problem. Want to bluetooth something.. A friend.. Easy want to listen to radio no mathata.. The list goes on and on

I hear ya. I've used both platforms, and rarely run into any problems here on Android. The fragmentation issue continues to get better with 64% of devices running ICS or Jelly Bean, and more often than not, it comes down to the developer coding properly, and not always the version of Android a user is running. I'm a heavy user of Google services, so everything just ties together. I'm sure you feel a similar way in regards to being tied into the Apple ecosystem with iOS and Mac OS X.

The long press for symbols is great, but is there a way to move from one row to the next without having to release, backspace to erase the symbol you didn't want, and then trying a different row? 

For instance, right now I'm not sure whether the @ symbol is on the middle or bottom row - so I longpress middle, and discover that it's not there. At this point I'd ideally like to keep holding down my finger and move it to the bottom row and discover the symbol I want is over there, move my finger to it, and finally release to get just the symbol I wanted.

Those are the only ones I can think of, but if you're worried about time, I can assure you that antutu only takes 10ish minutes. 
I prefer it over skype just because of the free group video calls. But yes, I think I can list 5 design flaws (at least) with hangouts android app off the top of my head. And why in the name of spaghetti doesn't it have a desktop client yet? 
I'm sorry, what is this for? I haven't been able to check messages for about a week and don't know what you're asking me to link... 
Yay! Enjoy! 
I know, but I'm talking about like an entire client like skype has. 
It definitely got to do with something you installed. I'm lazy, so I'd also factory reset just to fix it, but it'll be an issue with whatever you recently updated or installed. 
I'm with you, man. It's so painful to wait... 
Not really, but always make sure it works before you buy it and if you think it does and then it doesn't just demand a refund.

I'm going to vote for the htc one on this one. The camera is beyond phenomenal and its wicked fast. Also, it has a ton of awesome ROMs and nods if you're into rooting. 
Now playing 

I can confirm that it's really light. I can use it for hours on wifi with little drain compared subreddit sync. 
It's in the best release, and the dev is constantly updating it, so I'm expecting it within the next week or so! 
Why do the icons under posts not look embedded anymore? Is it supposed to be like this? It looks kind of funky and I liked it when they looked like a part of the cards.

How does one delete only individual letters on the mini layout without deleting the entire word? I often find myself making typos in words not in my dictionary and would love to just quickly correct them instead of retyping the entire word.

RFID
RFID stands for Radio-Frequency IDentification. The acronym refers to small electronic devices that consist of a small chip and an antenna. The chip typically is capable of carrying 2,000 bytes of data or less.

How RFID Works

How does RFID work? A Radio-Frequency IDentification system has three parts:

A scanning antenna
A transceiver with a decoder to interpret the data
A transponder - the RFID tag - that has been programmed with information.
The scanning antenna puts out radio-frequency signals in a relatively short range. The RF radiation does two things:
It provides a means of communicating with the transponder (the RFID tag) AND
It provides the RFID tag with the energy to communicate (in the case of passive RFID tags).
This is an absolutely key part of the technology; RFID tags do not need to contain batteries, and can therefore remain usable for very long periods of time (maybe decades).
The scanning antennas can be permanently affixed to a surface; handheld antennas are also available. They can take whatever shape you need; for example, you could build them into a door frame to accept data from persons or objects passing through.

When an RFID tag passes through the field of the scanning antenna, it detects the activation signal from the antenna. That "wakes up" the RFID chip, and it transmits the information on its microchip to be picked up by the scanning antenna.

In addition, the RFID tag may be of one of two types. Active RFID tags have their own power source; the advantage of these tags is that the reader can be much farther away and still get the signal. Even though some of these devices are built to have up to a 10 year life span, they have limited life spans. Passive RFID tags, however, do not require batteries, and can be much smaller and have a virtually unlimited life span.

RFID tags can be read in a wide variety of circumstances, where barcodes or other optically read technologies are useless.

The tag need not be on the surface of the object (and is therefore not subject to wear)
The read time is typically less than 100 milliseconds
Large numbers of tags can be read at once rather than item by item.

Ok. Be an ass hole. Have fun with that. Its gotten you so far in life. I was just pointing out that you have a problem that you need to have checked out and you get pissy with me!? Idk wtf is your problem lately but it's ferry a really old. Don't blame me for whatever it is that's making you miserable cause it damn sure isn't me. I paid you 550 bucks this month. I'm doing more than my fair share and would be nice to be treated as such. But I still treat me like shit. When was the last time you helped me with something? You are constantly coming up with excuses to not help me. Like. Ending my oil or helping me with my new home I'm buying. Things that a good father should want to do with his son. Especially being how we didn't have that kind of relationship while I was growing up but instead your too busy. I don't have a clue with what cause your house is running down so I know it not working on it. But yet you still can't make time for anyone. And then on top of that I have to pay for pills I get from you like I'm a customer? I understand you need money, I do too. But that's still ridiculous. Connie gives her son pills w/o pay. So it's not like its some unreasonable thing. But I do it to help you. And yet this is how I get treated in return. Damn you are a fucking ass hole.

After looking at their website, I discovered that it is a family run business and this makes me distinctly uncomfortable. It is these sorts of service providors that can stab you in the back at a moments notice. I might have a look at some of the properties that they have, but I will be a little dubious of them period.

Tried fiddling around with the settings, but to no avail. Not sure whether the app takes over the default notifications settings or not (?) but there is no mention of this. Maybe it's not compatible with my Galaxy Note 1.

It is, and hopefully over time, more developers will implement the Casting feature using the Google Cast SDK so that you can use it for more than just Netflix, Chrome and YouTube. I watched the launch event as well as the Motorola one this morning, Google has a lot of things going for it. But as you stated, Netflix is a US service that is only just available in UK and Nordic countries, so in Spain it not available (yet) and certainly not in Cyprus - which leaves you with only chrome and Youtube 

The device you own, HTC Media Link HD does the same thing, in essence, as it mirrors your phone on the tv, and allows you to do other things while your pictures or videos locally stored in your phone are played on the tv. The only noticeable bonus for the Chromecast is that it loads things from the Internet rather than your phone. However given its low price, its not a costly experiment for the living room. I have looked into buying one simply because I don't have the media link and this is a cheap viable option. However you'd need to find out where you can purchase one  

Love Hugo!

Do we need to arrange another evening drinking session ?
We all need tequila
Have you seen only God forgives ? If so what did you think of it ?
I've watched it. Its pretty interesting. Its not the type of film that should be shown at the mainstream cinema though. People won't get it. Not enough dialogue for the average cinema goer. Its got some gnarly themes and characters are all pretty damaged. I enjoyed it though
It reminds me of a lot of early miike where images and scenes to drive the story as opposed to dialogue
Also the main thai woman in it is fine as hell
Tequila later

Mike, 
As of right now it looks like the coil is out of my inventory. In the work order on my end I put in the internal notes that coil was sent to Florida for investigation. I am seeing a lot of emails now. Is there anything I need to do?

Okay. 

The lock in is this Friday at 7. 
Unfortunately we can only have kids in the benson and bailey youth groups and their parents or guardians be apart this time around. 
We will provide pizza and drinks. If you want other snacks please bring them. Feel free to bring any appropriate movies and games. 
If you play an instrument and want to practice together please do bring it. 
Bring your own bedding. 
And parents please pick up your child by 10am. 
Hope to see many of you this weekend!

Well, I wiped it and, upon signing back into your ID, everything came back and there is a system update available. Victory. 
Yeah. Common is just a point at which all things can ground to in the original cloudtoid, I just soldered all the grounds to the case. Lately, I've been using a wire twist. You can also use a terminal block. Also, in my later schematics, instead of an NC switch, I just use a normally open switch on the main power. The switch just has to be rated high enough to not blow with the power of the connector. That way, you can just leave the switch pin of the okr empty instead of the NC or a step down. 
I hope someday for it to be less relevant to me. 
Wow. JBQ quit. A sad day for Android.

Hi Nick,

Our use case is as follows:
We operate a let-only property portal primarily for Scottish letting agents. We aim to utilize the information available through yelp to improve the user experience for visitors of our landing pages (http://www.lettingweb.com/flats-to-rent/edinburgh for example).

These are pages that perform a specific location based search that we push heavily on the SEO front. We hope to add a map to the page showing businesses and locations of merit relevant to the context of a user looking to live in the given area defined by the page. So, for Edinburgh, we would be displaying parks, food, and activities to name a few - on a map and also showing review snippets for each. (in accordance with display reqs of course)

Re: cashing - to give our visitors the best possible set of interactive data each page would be populated with the results of 5 or more yelp api requests (one for each relevant category we want to display). Of our catalogue of landing pages, approx 320 different pages are hit each day. This makes an estimate of a minimum1600 api requests per day if we were to cache yelp data for 24hours. 

Naturally I don't like such a high number, and thought it may be possible to hold the data for up to 72 hours. We are not so much concerned with having real time information for our users, but more interested in giving them something else to look at and play with, and hopefully a reason to return to our site in future. No other UK property portal has anything like this available for their visitors.

Regards 

Andrew

When there is nothing to process, nothing is updated. Their properties will only change when a feed with data is processed.

And only when a property with a matching branch id is found are the agent's properties considered 'updated'. 

It has nothing to do with the file, but instead depends on properties in the file being matched to the agent. Without that, nothing happens, not even archiving.

Cheers 

Andrew

I'm to the point where I don't enjoy these MLS All-Star games. We put together the best of the league to play a prominent from usually Europe. The problem is that we are playing a team and not a group of guys who are usually on opposite sides of the ball. I don't like it and it makes our league look horrible.

I'm really not fond of the All-Star set up. Rather see an East versus West match.

I would not consider myself as a right wing fundamentalist. I am a Christ follower. I believe that somewhere down the line, evangelicals got added into this definition. As an evangelical Christian, I am called to evangelize. The writer was dedicating this piece to conservatives and trying to contrast them with liberal Christians.I feel that he sees only two groups of Christians that are opposite each other. However, there is more than the two groups. I know because I don't fit in either. Between you and I, though I am jobless, we tithe and even support a young boy in a very impoverished nation. As a family, we try to love others as ourselves, with our hands and feet and with what financial blessings we've been allotted by Jesus Christ. I do believe in a literal 6 days of Creation, but don't do so blindly. We have been tasked by our Creator God to take care of the Earth. As for war, I do believe there are legitimate reasons to fight, but I don't know if I have seen one since Hitler tried to take over the world and eradicate races. I am not for the American dream, but see it as a tool of Satan. God is first above family and money. However, I have been entrusted with many blessings and am called by God to be a good steward of them. See Ephesians 5. Women and men do have different roles. This doesn't mean they are to be confined to the house barefoot and pregnant. They are man's counterpart and helper. As Genesis states, He made both of them in His image. Just as Christ is God and equal to God. So is woman to man. Jesus submitted to God and His will. The wife is to do likewise. This doesn't mean I dictate everything, but rather we are to work together and if there is a disagreement with our direction, I am to seek council from the Lord in prayer. He works hearts and can change even the man's heart to understand the woman. 
I could go on and on. All of this to say I'm glad I'm like neither the writer or the subject. My problem with the liberal Christian worldview is that it fails to live up to the mandate given to us by Christ in Acts 1:8. It's all about a political view. As for the right wingers, they also have bastardized the Gospel with their worldview. Both fail to love their neighbor.

Like how expensive? 
The problem I have with it is that it's not going to change what the organization says its name is. We could use this same approach anywhere, but he'd be better off writing a piece about how this offends a people group with quotes from said people. The Washington Bullets changed to the Wizards, so anything is possible. However, I'm sure they'd lose a ton of money and fans. I wonder what they could change it to. 
Wow! 
Makes me think of how they wouldn't say Voldemort's name in Harry Potter.
Not sure if they have it here. 
I see what you're saying. I just don't think it's going to be a catalyst.

If they did, I could envision the NFL pulling their weight to make them sorry for trying. This isn't just a Washington issue. It's also an NFL issue.

Julie,

Do you know if the 4th grade class has a CD player to play the music?

Thanks

Well, I'm teaching Sunday School for the first time tomorrow. It's for the 4th graders. Those of you who pray, please do. 
I just had to post an acronym after seeing a post with so many that I had to take the time to figure them all out. 
Happy Birthday! 
Trust me. I know what I'm doing! 
Thanks!

So he stretched his legs to go for a stroll.

Thanks to the dev for this one. It's a very lightweight and minimalistic approach to sms/mms which is great considering all the bloated sms/mms apps out there. I love the way it handlesn picture messages, filling the entire "bubble" with content.   My only request: MMS over Wifi DOES work, but only if you still have data enabled in the background. I like to have keep my data turned off while my Wifi is on to conserve battery. Under these circumstances (wifi on, data off) the stock messaging app knows to enab

I am done with my 8. I have 2 more this morning and 2 this afternoon. 
I didn't. 
I guess I will call them back. Grrr. 
We should definitely go. We will bring the wine holders this time too! 
Oh gosh. I have no idea. I am terrible at that stuff. I would be happy to contribute though.

That probably works. If we are going to trade you can definitely up my contribution!

Just finished eating. I need to do the same! 
Thanks Dana. I can handle validation and remediation if needed when I get to the store in the am. 
That's my plan too. I am doing half day on Friday so I plan on busting it out Friday and Saturday morning. 
9343

I sure do miss you sweetie!

Yeah, I think I am done too. I have one more load of laundry to swap out though.

I was out too. I had to be in a little early so I am a little sleepy too!

Ok. Did you want to be there too or should I just have him come whenever? 
Ok sweetie. I wasn't sure how long you were planning on staying at the retirement. 
Are you sure that is the right number? 
That makes it nice! 
Hahaha that's ok! 
Apparently no one else has it yet so they were just getting rejected! 
I am home now so whenever is best for you. 
Do you need directions or did Val already tell you how to get here? 
Ok. 1113 St Andrews Ct Akron 44312 
Ok. I'll be here. 
Mike is going to come now. Well sort of. He has to stop at home first and get gas. 
Hahaha! I am beginning to wonder if I will get to see you tonight! ;)
Me too baby! 
Just got home. I am so sleepy tonight! 
That would feel wonderful! 
And I bet whatever came after would feel even better! 
All done with mike! 
Yeah it went fine. 
Should I head your way? 
I would be happy to come to you since I am all done. 
Ok! I might have to stop for gas but we will see! 
Ok. I am on my way. I think I am going to need to stop. 
Ok!

Its so lonely here without you. 
I miss you so much! 
I don't like it either sweetie. It is so much nicer having you next to me!

I am done!

How is your afternoon sweetie? 
Yay! I am officially on vacation! 
Don't I wish!

Although I suppose my carpet is probably dirty enough to grow potatoes! 
I'll be out of town on vacation. You are being bs'd.
Hahaha! 
I would hate to make them sad.

Do you have swimming trunks at moms? 
Me too baby but at least we have some time to figure it out. 
At least I have spilled my guts so I don't have to worry about carrying a secret! 
Should I run to Kohl's in the am?

I would like to be apart of the fall volleyball season. Let me know what the fees are and I will have it paid as soon as possible. I think there was another email I needed to reply to about a dinner or party, but I can't remember what the details where. If it was about availability then I am free any day at the moment.

Canceled Plans 
I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning so playing in the fall softball league may be difficult. 

I was called out to work in Lafayette this morning. It should be roughly a thirty day job but can always turn into more or less. I will know more next week, but I wanted to let you know asap so you can make the right decision for the team to maybe move me back to a substitute. The job could end before the season starts but like I said I'll know a little more next week. 
Back to Lafayette for work come Monday. It should be more profitable this time, lol.

I should be able to make it to the game then! They switched me to work in Terre Haute for four tens! Yes, I love four tens.

@PopeSnogginheim that's all I've been saying, too. Don't be a coward about it. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries we've indoctrinated western culture? Because I think most cultures are male dominated and sorely overlooked the importance of respecting women in general. 
Do you think it's because over the centuries Black American culture has indoctrinated western civilization's culture? It seems most cultures, globally, are male dominated and most have sorely overlooked and downplayed the importance of respecting women and how important women are to any society in general. 
To go further; it seems this lack of respect/recognition of importance, is more damaging to black women. Stereotypically, black women already have such a damaged reputation (which I don't subscribe to personally), depsite the fact this idea of black women being relegated to baby mama's, gold diggers, and women of promiscuity aren't true in the majority of cases. 
I think the truth -like with most stereotypes- is that a small percentage of women validate a false overarching stereotype that imprison the majority of women who aren't really like that. 
Am I wrong for viewing it this way? I am not a woman (no surprise), so I don't know what women go through, but I would like a better understanding. 
I think all people under the boot of malicious stereotypes and damaging reputations seem to put this faux sense of responsibility and intense pressure on themselves to fix or change a problem that most likely isn't theirs to begin with...

I thought Vick said he forgave Cooper and that LeSean McCoy said that it was too big. I could be wrong. 

http://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--michael-vick-helping-to-clean-up-riley-cooper-s-mess-193236048.html 

To change direction... It's strange how some of the same people who generally never forgave Vick for what he did, are now rushing to decide what is and isn't forgivable for others coupled with how quickly they should move on. But the N-word is the double standard they want to focus on?
How overt is enough?

A lifetime ban is excessive, because I do believe people have the capacity to change.... but since we are focusing this on Vick's story; anyone care to talk about the hypocrisy of never forgiving Vick, but demanding people get over this and forgive Cooper because he apologized? Vick apologized to and did his time.

That said at least Cooper's apology seemed genuine and he wasn't looking to blame the usual suspects (pun intended) for his own doing.

[quote="Gonzo"]Warren Sapp was a one-of-a-kind defensive tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and his bust in Canton will be the first of its kind.

Sapp could have been bald on his bust. He had that look for most of his years in Tampa Bay, actually, and had a shaved head for his biggest moment, when the Buccaneers won a Super Bowl. He goes with a shaved head these days too. But Sapp will be the first of many to have braids and cornrows on his bust. It's a sign of changing styles.

Wait until Polamalu makes it....[/quote]

I think it's cool that his bust has cornrows. Polamalu's will be cool, too. The next hairstyle will be dreads, then the frohawk, maybe?

What more is he supposed to do? And what does him being an ex-con have to do with him being offended. I guess he loses that right from now huh?

Nice.. Something slimmer, this Otter Box is too bulky. 
Its Oprah tho.... You think she had on cheap anything? Cmon bruh. Her lounge clothes outfit probably the same cost at smart car or a Prius.... But if that how you want to chalk it up, do you. 
To George Serapis well of course. They're just getting a taste of an everyday struggle for others, but they're going to be pissed because discussions on race are going to be more and more prevalent...
What other white billionaire can you look at and say the same? And I mean with out knowing who they are, what they own, or what they're driving? Like Tom Ford or Armani suits have big ass logos... Cmon now. 
Well I definitely agree with that. The more appropriate term is implicit bias. We all have those. 
I don't disagree with any of that really... And I don't really know fashion like that either. 

I agree that it's true, we all have implicit biases... I'm just saying - it's one thing to be uncertain what a billionire looks like when they come in to your store to shop. It's another to be certain of who isn't a billionaire based on what they look like and treat them a certain way because of it. It is a mixture of both classism and racism because the assumed limit and treatment based on the assumed limit. 
It's not like this is mall... It's a designer boutique. In Switzerland.

Kevin... If the minimum wage is raised to $15 bucks at fast food joint it highly unlikely 
Kevin, If the minimum wage is raised to $15 bucks at fast food joint for a cook or a cashier, it highly unlikely that they will get any salary increase of significance.... Unless moving up to a management role. 
Also, with a raise in minimum wage typically leads to a raise in almost all salaries... Or else most would quit their gig - unless they really enjoyed it - and start working at the closest ff joint.. Which would logically result in more competitive salaries based on the number of people qualified and the market for any given position. 
The fact that your wife makes less than $14 an hour is a result of the current minimum wage... Because if they raise it, she could work retail in the mall and make more than she does now. That would put pressure on her employer to make a decision... If he values her work. It would be hard to fill any position that pays less than the minimum wage because at that point people can take easier jobs that pay better... Which The key factor in your comparison to the military is unbalanced because as Chris explained the military do not incur the other living expenses that a fast food worker would (healthcare, room, and board etc) so those two aren't that comparable. However, the argument itself seems to be coming from a moralistic perspective and kind of sententious in foundation. That takes any possibility of a logical approach to your point of view

In her defense, she campaigned hard to be the monkey in Choke.
@KristiNoem PRISM. Irony.
And Marie Mathews is 16 years old and a Conneticut teenager at Archie Andrews High School. She's editor of the school paper and has a shot to graduate early, with an academic scholarship. Which bugs her. 
Why? The first semester is almost over, and she's doing very well. This is the first year being head of the class is possible. It nags at her though, because her old friend and neighbor Angel Glover used to be first in their class. 
Angel had been the top student, but then over the summer his Dad was in an incident with a mugger and was shot dead. Angel apparently hasn't been dealing with it very well; he shows up late to class constantly, and he wears heavy sweaters constantly to apparently cover bruises. Rumors persist that he's getting into drugs or gangs; harsher rumors sat he's prostituting himself. 
And isn't one to believe rumors though, and tries reaching out to her friend. She's also a little curious where they stand, because they made out a little at a Fourth of July harvests, before his Dad died. Angel is very curt though, brushing her off. 
The scholarship Ann wants typically goes to whoever wins the Science Award at the end of the year. She has competition from Angel, as well as Irene, who is much more ruthless than either. Items would rather not have her competition be a factor anymore.

Laura lo primero que tienes que hacer es repasar todo e intentar hacer todo sin mirar al libro :)



Ejercicios para Laura:

1. (x+3)^2
2. (x+4)(x+4)
3. (x+4)(x-4)
4. (x^2+2x-15)/(x+5)
5. (x^2+x-20)/(x-4)
6. (x^2+2x-8)/(x+2)
7. (x^2-5x-14)/(x-7)
8. (x^2-6x-7)/(x+1)
9. (2a+b)^2
10. (2a+b)(a-2b)

Que igualdad notable da cada caso ? (si te sabes la definicin no tienes problema)

1. x-4
2. x^2+6x+9
3. x^2-4x+4

Halla Races (sin mirar el libro anda)

1. x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
2. 2x^2 - 7x + 3 = 0
3. -x + 7x - 10 = 0
4. x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0
5. 2x - 3 = 1 - 2x + x^2
6. x^2 + (7-x)^2 = 25
7. 7x^2 + 21x + 28 = 0 (Primero simplifica)
8. 18 = 6x + x*(x - 13)
9. 6x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0
10. 4x^2 - 6x + 2 = 0
11.  x^4 - 8x^2 +16 = 0 (pista se hace un cambio de variable: x^2 = t)(t es como si fuese una nueva x) 
12.  Ecuacin no compatible  (busca un mtodo para resolverlo)

Where is the mountain ?

I notice no difference in the snappiness, but love the new settings! 
Salim
Sali
Bataya na CAP se door ki college me hua. Toh 
The keyboard is definitely snappier, and the new settings are amazing. (whenever I try to intentionally miss the space, and enter a new word, it doesn't work, but that isn't a feature that was absolutely necessary... So, awesome work guys! )
One suggestion. Most of the time, I don't really miss the space, but the keyboard registers it as a few separate letters. 

Like, 

"Fleksy is awesome! " 

Becomes 

Fleksy isgjaersome 

Between is and awesome, the keyboard registered the letters gj, or gh, or hj. 

Would it be possible for the keyboard to recognise when this happens, and change "isgjawesome" to "is awesome" 

It would be a really neat feature, what do you think guys?

     Everyone was pointing out at something in the distance, with terrified faces. Aditya got up from his seat, made his way through the crowd, while maintaining his balance in the shaky local train. Local trains in India, are quite different, compared to other countries. The biggest difference being that their doors are always open, whether the train is stationary, or moving. And the trains shook a lot. Enough to make a person unable to maintain balance without holding on to something.
And yes, we are being unable to contact rahima, (we are getting the message 'the number you have dialed is not in service'). Please give us the correct contact number.

Once there was a boy named bruno. He had 2 siblings. They all had become happy during summer vacations, so they told their dad they want to go to Miami for a picnic. 

After 3 days, they left in their car, and were on their way. But, just 4 km before their destination, their car broke down. So they all got off, and decided to walk. But just then, they were attacked by elephants! 

bruno's dad used a saw to fight all 18 elephants , and killed everyone of them. They continued walking. 

After 21 days, they finally reached miami, but they were feeling very amazing . So they all went to relax in their hotel. 

The next day, they all went to the beach, and we're relaxing, when super star mike posner came running, with a mob of 6 people behind him for autographs. Suddenly, * walked up to *, and said, run for your lives!

?Andy wants a job as a signalman on the railways. He is told to meet the inspector at the signal box. The inspector puts this question to him: "What would you do if you realised that two trains were heading for each other on the same track?"Andy says, "I would switch the points for one of the trains.""What if the lever broke?" asked the inspector. "Then I'd dash down out of the signal box," said Andy, "and I'd use the manual lever over there." "What if that had been struck by lightning?" "Then," Andy continues, "I'd run back into the signal box and phone the next signal box." "What if the phone was engaged?" "Well in that case," persevered Andy, "I'd rush down out of the box and use the public emergency phone at the level crossing up there." "What if that was vandalised?" "Oh well then I'd run into the village and get my uncle Silas."This puzzles the inspector, so he asks, "Why  would you do that?" Came the answer, "Because he's never seen a train crash."

Been doing these, what I'll call "bike instructor fartleks" this week. A few of these have shown up on here, but a few I didn't bother to record. Basically, while teaching my son to ride a bike, I'm running and walking with him. It's an interesting workout because it goes from a walk to a sprint at odd intervals. And now that he's more self-sufficient it's getting harder for me to keep up! 

Also, this was more like 2.0 miles because my phone

Testing Fleksy 
I am now going to try and fart up some piggies. This is Fleksy and I am trying to make it fail. The first sentence came out perfectly except it didn't know the word piggies yet. But now it does! 

Ok... Here's the deal. It lets me do an ellipsis by hitting space 2 more times after the period. Beautiful! 

Unfortunately there is no help with smileys.

Unfortunately there is no help with smileys. No smiley love! But I am getting used to it after some time. This is really pretty good! It feels stiff and inflexible at first when you're used to swiping words. I really do like swiping!! And this is stationery see? I tried typing starting to and it came up as stationery. 

Blimey. It knows blimey! 

Toby Flenderson. 

Is this better than swiping in Android? I don't know. My instinct is that it isn't. Because I do love how responsive swiping is!

I guess it depends on what's clogging it. If it's old food, just clear it out manually. Might wanna wear gloves for that. Garbage disposal? Run it with water and a little bleach maybe? Using know if kitchen sinks are good candidates for liquid plumber etc. But that works great in the bathroom. 

Good luck! 
Did one of those work? 
Check a bottle of liquid plumber or drano and see if it's safe for kitchen sinks or not. I imagine it is, but not sure.

Not a definite, but it is our last regular weekday before school starts and I've been so busy lately I hate to miss more time with them. They may of course decide they'd rather not!

Either would be fine. The benefit to doing it Friday would be that I have no hard out time while they're out of school. Also, I talked with them and they won't be coming either way, as neither one enjoys Indian food and they're quite good at staying home alone nowadays. So! Friday would work great for me. One day next week might, also. But not Labor Day.

And the value is not only because of petrol. We import crude oil. And then after treatment in the refineries, it gives various byproducts such as petrol, diesel, tar, etc. You can't stop transportation of goods, which takes up a lot of necessary diesel. And so does machinery in factories, etc.

Unfortunately, I have been caught up with an unavoidable commitment at that time. Could my service call be rescheduled to Friday, 23-Aug-2013 between 10 am and 12 noon?

Had a dream that I was in healy, I saw Rocky. Backed up my car and went over to his house, talked to his mom for a long time. Mostly about a complex fan and irrigation system for her house plants. Also, one of her kids was sleeping in the attic. An overal pleasant experience.

Let me check.

Yeah. I need to shower. 
Can I go? 
Omw 
I'm at the hospital. They're probably going to take my phone away. 
I love you. What are you doing? 
Because finer things. I see. Well everything checked out okay. My head is fine. It still doesn't hurt. Which seems weird. 
I will. 
Because too much food? 
Or be
Or because emotional stuff? 
I want you to be okay. I love you. 
I'm sorry my love. Everything is okay. My parents done want to keep me away from you. 
I know. They said we should go camping at double lakes in coldspring. 
For a change in scenery for both of us. 
I think you should. 
I think that would help all around. 
I an
They won't do it on their own. I could tell them to. But I know that totally defeats the point. 
Do you think you ever will? 
Okay. Yeah I didn't mean now. You have finer things. 
Okay. When you have time one day I'll set it up. 
Its to get me better. They don't understand howmuj 
Its to get me better. They don't understand how much you help. 
I know. 
I told gretchen about the misunderstanding. And how it made me feel. I told my parents I just felt terrible. 
Not exactly. Idk. I'll try to set them straight. 
I know. 
But it isn't your fault. 
I'm so sorry.. I was talking to my parents. 
I love you. My dad understands. My mom doesn't want to think differently. 
Good luck at trivia :)
You don't have to go to trivia. 
Oh nice! Have you ever won? 
Awww. Well good for you, my love. I'm glad. 
I know. Will you want to see me later? 
Okay. Well I want to see you. 
It isn't cheap and fake. My dad understands. You can't worry about my mother she's scared and protective. 
You aren't the bad guy. But you should try to talk to her. She's reasonable. She can at least understand your perspective. 
You aren't wrong. Just explain it to them 
Nice! 
Keep it up! 
He gets it. 
You have to try again. 
Okay. Then my father understands. He's the important one. My mother is just there. 
That isn't true she thinks you're wonderful. But that right now you aren't good for me. Which isn't true j
I don't want her to. 
She doesn't want to blame you. 
She only will be of you let her like this. 
A3
I don't know. You have to try to talk to her. 
He
She afraid to talk to you because she doesn't know what offended you so badly and she's afraid she'll do it again. 
No. I know she did something wrong. I'm trying to speak for her. I'm telling her what she thinks. What's shed said. Not what I think. 
U
I do. But you're bad. Or something. And I can't say anything right. So now is not the time. 
Yes. 
It isn't what I want she's crazy. I want you. I'd cut her out if I could. 
Okay. 
I understand. I'll try to 
I understand. I'll try to be better about it. 
I'm going to walk. 
I love you too. I do
I love you too. I know. He soiled everything. I'm sorry. 
Are you on your computer? 
So I can use it? 
Thanks. 
Computer? 
Okay. And maybe. Idk 
That makes me so happy i
I know. I really love you too. I've never felt anything like it. It was so powerful today. It stop is more than usual. Ok so incredibly glad I found you. 
Is still is more powerful than usual. I'm so incredibly glad I found you. 
A.
Yeah we should do that. 
I want to see you. I love you. 
I'm glad. I love you. Have a good time with angie :)
I miss you too. I want to see you as soon as I can. You aren't watching gatsby are you? 
Oh okay. I'm glad. I want to see gatsby 
I know. It shouldn't make you feel awful. It should make him feel awful. You're perfect my love. 
What did I say? What happened should make you feel bad. 
Can you explain how it makes you feel bad? It isn't your fault. At all. Its completely his fault. You did nothing wrong. 
You did nothing but back away and leave. That's exactly perfect for the situation. 
Why? You shouldn't. You aren't dirty. He is a drunk lonely guy in his twenties. He treats his cat like a girlfriend. He wasn't thinking straight. You were talking about me for gods sake. There was nothing you did that made him think he should try to kiss you. 
No. You shouldn't feel bad. 
Shouldn't. 
I looked. I said shouldn't. 
What? You should not feel bad about what happened. Whatever I said before. You shouldn't feel bad. 
Its okay. You really shouldn't feel bad. You were talking about your boyfriend and he tries to kiss you. Even I realize how fucking fucked up that is of him. 
It isn't you. They don't he was drunk and horn fd
It isn't you. They don't. Alex was drunk and horny. That's it. 
I'm not even allowed to take savagery 
I'm not even allowed to take advantage of you when you're drunk. He surely isn't. He's he just drunk and stupid. 
They don't. They want you. And hope you want them
They don't. They want you. And hope you want them. But they will never know unless they try. So they try. It has nothing to do with deserving you. 
Because you're amazing. You're an absolutely amazing person. 
Because it wasn't about you. It was selfish to make a move on someone with a significant other. It was about them and their crush. Not you. 
I know. You can't give them that power. 
I miss you too. When can I see you? 
No. Not at all. You need to make it perfectly clear to all that you aren't looking for attention. Send random people on their way if they try to talk to you. 
I know. Maybe you can do uh main. Or uhcl. Or if you're lucky get someone to take over the lease. And you can go to utsa 
I'm sorry my love. Its just temporary. You're there because you have to be in school for financial aid. Not because you can't be somewhere better. 
I know. Not a year. A semester is fine. 
Its okay. I love you. Everything will work out. 
Yeah. Understand.

On track would have been going to uhcl but they did everything they could to keep you from getting in. So you went to San jac for financial aid. It isn't that bad. 
I'm going to be late. But I'll be there. 
No. Everything is okay. I love you very much. 
I'm so sorry my love. Everything will be okay. 
I'm here. 
How are you? 
You can probably still switch out of geology. 
I'm sorry your feet smell :(
Don't flash people! :( because it's boring? 
I'm not sure. Geology isn't going towards anything though, right? Take something fun. 
Then take something fun! Scrap booking. Or art. Or s
Then take something fun! Scrap booking. Or art. Or anything. Don't bore yourself with a class you don't even need. 
Okay. And that's really annoying. I'm sorry, my love. 
Shelby, are you okay, my wonderful? 
Alright. It'll take me a bit to learn your schedule. 
I'm sorry. :( are there any classes I could go to you with? 
I did the dishes. I'm not sure what to do with all the clothes on the ground. 
Okay. I'll just throw them all in the dirty. 
How about your clothe.

I'm going to play my stupid game for a while. I think it will help. Then I want to see you. I want to see you now. But I know it's hard on you. And I don't want that. 
I will, my love. 
I love you too. 
Haha Where people do what?

:P
I think computers have run their course in terms of creating new bill gates and Steve jobs. What I need to do is learn how to merge cells with technology. The amount of data that cells can hold of incredible. If we could use that, it would completely change how companies like Google store their information.

She's open minded. She doesn't think she did what you said because she was crazy at the time. Because of what I was doing. If you tell her what she did wrong and how you interpreted it and why, she'll change her mind. But she doesn't remember it properly. That's why she thinks why she does 
No. You can 
No. She's open to the fact that she doesn't remember it properly.

Seismic body waves propagate outwards in all three dimensions from the earthquake source. Regardless of the quality of the soil, they're still propagating outwards from the source. The waves have some frequency, and the seismic Q measures how much energy is lost per wave cycle. This is the reason low frequencies of, e.g., sound waves, travel farther--low frequency waves cycle slower, so they decay slower energy is lost per cycle. On the west coast, seismic Q is lower, so the amplitude of the waves decays faster. East of the Rockies, the ground is cool and stable; the seismic Q is higher, so the seismic waves decay less remotely.

East of the Rockies, the ground is cool and stable; the seismic Q is higher, so the seismic waves decay less rapidly. That means that you can feel the seismic waves at a far longer distance from the source, because the seismic waves have attenuated less at some distance compared to on the west coast.

Yes. Generally, colder = older = more stable. Cold, stable lithosphere typically transmits seismic waves with much better efficiency that warm, fractured lithosphere. 
Reinforced concrete or steel skeleton buildings will probably be fine. Wood houses will probably fine. It's the unreinforced masonry that will fail catastrophically. 

Masonry doesn't flex, it crumbles. Steel and wood flex. If you have reinforced masonry (like concrete with rebar, for instance), the masonry might crumble, but the reinforcement will hold it together.

As an example, look at all the damage the recent Virginia earthquake caused. There were many, many houses that were left completely undamaged, but their chimneys (unreinforced masonry) collapsed or fell away from the house. 
Each building has its own resonance frequencies; basins have their own resonance frequencies, and specific sites of their own resonance frequencies. If any of those match up with the frequency of the seismic waves that hit, you could get some good swaying.

Wow. Haha. 

Oh, that's odd. Why is that? 
That's not good if I seem always engaged with my phone. I try not to. I used to never use my phone. Until I got this job. Then I got my first smart phone. All down hill from there. I am glad most of the reason I am on it is for people. But even that feels a bit much for me. 

Haha, there is truth in that. But I appreciate you at least attempting to have a phone. Smoke signals can get a little inconvenient. And it would have been hard to receive that panda picture. 

Hahaha! That would be extremely interesting. I can imagine how invisible awkward that can suddenly become as a protester. Banana. 

Texting in a church building, or texting while sitting in service? 

I always thought the same thing about that song! Its just really awkward. 

It kind of feels like, "taadaa! Here I am, worshipping you! "

Well that's good to know. Yes, I don't like people seeing me on my phone either. Nor do I like seeing people on their phone. It makes me feel like they are blocking out the world. But I know that's just something I need to get over. Haha. I think being smartphoneless for so long, I became an antagonist of their effects on society. Need to start looking at the good things too. And not assume the bad things. 

Hahaha. Scrolling home screens.. I do the same thing. And clicking on random folders. 

I relayed your idea to our front door security. We'll see how it plays out. 

Ah, yes. Agreed. To it being weird texting around people. I still do it, unfortunately, haha. For reasons related to the first paragraph. 

Yes, heart. But I have to admit I can't help but feel it's like, "Tadaa! I am here worshipping you." Lord forgive. 

Its how we roll. Me too. I can't handle what you call.. chatspeak. 

I don't know if I am apart of that obsession, but man they crack me up. Almost as much as you do.

Hi Namrataa,

The medium of instruction would be Hindi and English mixed and in if the speaker is fluent in Marathi that can also be done.

About the fees you give us a idea what would be the amount that the students could very well afford or spend for something this educative about film-making and we can arrange something around that. 

We also have expenses to bear, like the rent of the cameras, editing machine, editor and some guest lecturers whom we have to pay.

Hello,

This is Suket Dedhia here from Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra. I am physically handicapped and would like to know which vehicles would Maruti personalize for me.

My driving fitness certificate issued by, 
"ALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION" that says that I can drive a car with automatic transmission.

So what I would specially like to know is whether Maruti can customize any of the cars from your list or are there some specific models that can only be customized for these kind of requests. 

Thank You,
Suket Dedhia

If all of us Mumbaikars would have been morally awake, this incident would never had happened. The girl would not have had to undergo this pain and trauma. She would have been happily working on her next assignment. No deal of condolences or sympathy shown towards the girl would ever make up for her.

?Hi had tears in my eyes when I read about the Mumbai gang-rape. What happened in Delhi was bad enough, but the same thing happening in my city? I could not enamulate that, I have always known Mumbai; as a place where our mothers, sisters and friends can walk back home late at night without any fear. A city protected by Devi Mumba.

These are not normal people, they are animals. A normal person under anykind of intoxication would not dare to rape. These rapists are psychologically ill, they're mentally unstable and a threat to the society. We often neglect and avoid such drugsters and urchins who lurch in our surroundings. This is the result of that neglection.

There shouldn't be any punishment lesser than death for the rapists. It is the lack of the fear of the consequences that makes these socio-paths go around. This time we will show them the consequences. We will teach them that the we would spare anybody doing wrong to our sisters, mothers, friends or any girl walking on the road. 

To the Mumbai Police, I say this, "we have faith in you and know that you would do your duty well, it is a humble request on behalf of entire Mumbai, do not spare the culprits. The poor girl does not sympathy she wants justice, give that to her".

I as a citizen of Mumbai, pledge here that I will do everything I can to keep my city safe.

@me4oslav Ubuntu tweak has a really nice tool for this. I don't have to look for stuff, it scans and asks me if I want to delete everything

Haha no problem. Is it an android phone? And I completely understand that. I see it a little differently though. When you're in a willing relationship and you accept a title like slave it's not showing force. I'd say it shows the opposite in that you're strong enough he that to someone and not lose yourself.

Hello
Hi Chef I hope all is well with you and your family, just wanted to touch basis and see how everything was. I'm doing very well, almost 2 years sober and my kids are doing great. I'm full time building my own business in financial services, I help families save money on life insurance and put them in the best mutual funds, etc... To give them the best rate of return on their money. Communication is vital in all businesses so I just wanted to put the word out Fyi, this is my niche and something I'm very passionate about. Thanks for everything over the years, you instilled alot of great characteristics in me, although it took me some time to finally apply them LOL. See ya around!

Thanks In Advance

Apparently zolpidem makes you see spiders. Hence they much prefer zopiclone or good old downtown if they can get it. Diazepam makes you invisible which is brilliant for shoplifting purposes.

Just eat takeaway everyday and stack the wrappers up in the kitchen as a tribute to your laziness. 
Hooray. 
Yep. Pizza boxes stack well. Can you get those munchy things from the kebab shops round your way? Its maybe just a Scottish thing but they fill a pizza box with everything greasy like chips and donner meat and more chips and then throw hot sauce around and a tiny bit of lettuce wilted in the corner? Well have one of them everynight and you won't get poisoned.

Buying things is for losers. 
Dvd's are still available. But only for the very poor who use them as a currency to buy heroin. Th middleman "cash converters" converts the dvds into heroin. Its a booming industry. 
Music magpie is only for the rich who have computers is it not? When heroin addicts can afford computers.... Well I am stuck for analogy.... Just imagine something unimaginable. 
Crossing the border. 
Wow your heroin addicts must be highly educated. Ours are Inbred fucktards who at best can play tinny shit music on their stolen phones. I don't think they know about the Internet yet.

Hi Rafael 

The place I used was budget rent a car and the van was $100 for the day. It was also a deep minivan and not a cargo van.

Uhaul seems to be the only cheap option. 

I've rented some scary vehicles from them though. One had a blowout at 70 mph. Fucked up. 

Yes, a beer soon!

Goto list accounts and change all passwords there. Should be 4-5 accounts. 

I don't think email is compromised as this was due a bug in wp or web files, but change them nonetheless. 

After changing waste and dev password, you can use dev folder for new uploads which I'll merge with backup later.

Nope, I just love the stuff in currently doing lol. With this you should go into porn
Guess I didn't. Bye
Byeee. You'll learn not to tell guys about other guys all the time, and call them f words all the time 
And no I didn't do that. Yet.
Of course not 
Do what you please 
Yes I would and im sorry feel better, and no I don't like another I'm just reading 
Don't feel that. And maybe precious you should learn to not say things you don't mean. Imagine how you'd feel if I told you things the way you told me. I know you'd definitely not care to fight.
Maybe I would, if you didn't begin all this with me first.
Okay, well I'd fight if you didn't say things that make you not worth fighting for. And don't feel that. Go to your beloved dad.
Well tell me, if I did to you what you did to me, would you fight? And well who caused that.
Well no baba, I'm not saying leave, I just want you to realise what had you've done and if you believe that you can be good?<%
Bad*, <3*
Is this the course you truly want ? <3 and tell me, I should watch you this entire year with boys?
Also, you never wasted my time<3
Don't say that, I love you, except when you're truly just trying to belittle me<3
Please don't say that you're making me tear :(
Why are you saying things that aren't true, you deserve this life you just need change <3
Aren't I still here?<3
Well once again, you brought that to yourself, but I'm sorry<3 and why don't you call a psychiatric facility then?
Precious I'm listening and why? So I can see you go off with guys?
Precious that's why I told you to go to a psych place, I'm not a psychiatrist and please don't :( and that will happen with you:(<3
Well maybe you should go to a therapist to get better baba ? :(<3
Well yes baba, once more and if not, no break, but a therapist, okay?<3
Okay good<3 and I want all that too baba <3
Because of the fighting its made me tired of it:( and baba can we sleep?:(<3
Precious you're starting to turn back into what caused all this<3
Precious for the millionth time that was my uncle
Not when my phones dead 
I'm not... 
Okay clearly this isn't working
Cause I didn't charge it cause my plug slightly fell out without me seeing it
In not making excuses, all I want to do is sleep
Precious I am tired, and you have to prove its worth staying up/:
Yes, if you didn't say certain things that's how I'd be/:
Of course baba <3
Of course precious, but since you have been taking that away lately, maybe you should try and help me fix it?<3
How about you try to be good and not say the things you say for a start?<3
Precious don't speak like that, respect yourself to get mine back instead of all that?<3 and just don't say things you don't mean <3 and deactivate the nonsense <3
Okay baba -.-<3 then just do those things and he's yours <3
If you do all I asked (:<3 and if we can sleep cause I almost fell asleep -.-<3 sowwy -.-<3

I know. Its Thursday lol. Holy shit. This has been the most unproductive week of my life. 
We always do somehow~ 

Lmao I just want things my way. 
Um yes. A bunch of people have asked me how to block numbers on their iphones. Turns out you have to jail break. Yuck. 
Grouping ? The automatic folder names ? I like that we can have this convo lmao. 

Oh we're keeping track of insults now ??

Forever:)

Lmaoooo I know I read it and killed myself but whatever test me. 
Um no. I was thinking about that the other day. And came to the conclusion that I don't ever not want to see you for that long of a period. 

Sure. So um your existence and pure basic goal in life is to reproduce ( basic level , don't get your lace panties in a bunch) and nature has given women

Nothing worth mentioning. Biggest thing I did this week was changing the part in my car and getting my social security card redone. Depressing. 

I wish ! I am really getting into design though. Like getting an itch to learn and do shit. In terms of aesthetic design. So maybe soon I'll just say "download my app" 
Like the gray slate thing that pops up?
I haven't experienced group messaging but I'm sure it sucks. Actually....yes. I have but not with iPhone. Some bitch decided to send a group msg because of number change and ten others texted back. That sucked. 

Haha you're right it wouldn't even be a fair contest.

Everything. You can change the dpi of the phone. So you can like have different apps with different dpis. If you want like an app in tablet mode instead of regular phone mode. There's halo which basically this little ball that allows you multitask way better. The kernels give great battery life and just so much crap. Finally satisfied with a rom lol.

Greetings,
 
As you are aware, the training department is rolling out the new online assessment system for Information Explosion.  If possible, I would like to have a member of my team attend your conference call with your respective District Managers next week to discuss the new system.  I don't see that what we have to discuss will take up a large part of the time and we will be sure to keep it short.
 
Please let me know if you can accommodate us on your scheduled call.  If so, please let me know the times and the call-in information.
 
Thanks,
 
 
 
Marvin

Yes she is but her dad doesn't like the heat and he was there for 40 years. 

Would be nice except Nats thinks it weird to have Internet friends. I totally agree with all that you said, hence why I said 'grave'. Like a lot of legends there's usually real people behind them that get built up into the legend

That's it, you have no choice but to live with it yeah. The sign of a good relationship, when you each know the unsaid things. I think that's a reasonable thing to think in the circumstance.

oh he was born there. Only Nats mum is British. It doesn't matter I think. 

Yeah I know it's a modern version of thatreally. That wwould be a cool addition but perhaps King Arthur would be a better choice as more well known.

Jailbreaking basically just gives you what android has anyway. And android had the whole customize it any way you want point too. Not just sharing. Also, replacing default apps. Also, real multitasking. Rooting an android phone just gives you complete freedom.

Miranda I think it is, I get frustrated with it but always come right back lol 
Juan hahahaha!! You don't want to waste anytime getting xp, what are you even doing on here right now? Lol
Sadie I'm sorry... I have an addiction lol
I'll eventually get sick and tired of it though... Though there's really no telling how long that'll be lol
Juan you better listen to her man, she works there and she's a pro! Haha

Constance I have high end loft, late night, world adventures, and generations... I'm kinda considering getting the boat one since its half off and I love boats lol 
I'm on a rampage, someone needs to stop me!!! 
:O no I didn't... I didn't even know there was one. 
Gonna go watch it right now haha 
Constance I agree! Smh lol. But I've been getting lucky with deals! I paid six bucks for the actual game and two bundled expansions, I think they were high end loft and late night. And I just bought generations and world adventures for $20. 
Juan do you know the release date? I was thinking like sometime next year? 
Yeah 
Yeah you will, just be patient! You got this!!! I think! Haha

I don't know if anyone has experienced this problem before on their samsung s3, but whenever I try to install applications on my phone by all and the virtual install button comes up, I tap the install button but nothing happens. All I can press is the cancel button. Restarting the phone doesn't make any difference.
Please I need your help. Thanks.

Thanks so much for replying! You are the only one I've ever gotten herbal incense from so I only have experience with you guys' product. We stopped for a while because of a bad experience with taking one hit of the settled powder at the bottom and hubby flipping out and having like superhuman strength and thinking he was at the middle of a black hole or something and throwing me around the room (in his state he didn't even know I was there). But I just got a job and they do saliva tests so I need something to chill me out at the end of the day that I can pass a drug test on. Something mellow that won't give me a bunch of energy or anything...but that isn't too weak either. Just need it to de-stress in place of "the real thing". Lol. Any recommendations? I like peppermint, fruity flavors like mango, peach, blueberry, and natural spice flavors. I have a bunch of bulk damiana too so if you had the straight powder youth use to make it more potent I'd be cool with that too. Thanks again. 
No it was a visa debit card. I found another site that will accept it. Thanks. 
How did you come up with $400? We need groceries bad... Thank goodness I get paid friday
Mmmm kinda a mix of chili and lasagna... Yummy! Screenshotted this one. Thanks for sharing.
Well that's something going for you at least. 
Well it's not a comfy job so don't be too jealous lol. Its basically a 10 hour workout with one 30 min lunch and two 15 min breaks (really more like two 5 min breaks cause the rest is spent walking to and from your work area and going through security to get to break room).

Hi Aj, thanks alot for giving me this second chance and I won't let you down. My partners and I are extremely grateful for this opportunity. I will let you know when I'll be taking the 100 cases of TYKU as you know I invested in Cavoda vodka and awaited some return to begining investing in other brands such as TYKU.
I believe I'll be able to take the 100 cases from you by the end of December, I hope that is okay with you and again thanks alot, also sorry we couldn't stick around but I hope your other meeting went just as well lol! 

Best Regards, Oudine James
Yes December! I placed all of my financing into Cavoda vodka and I had to move the cases off to make my investment back, I will get it done before that but I just said December just to be safe but don't worry I will have plenty of time to introduce it into the market before carnival!

I haven't lived on the streets in over 15 years, the weather here in southern California might make it a little easier. 

The only thing about being homeless is that the rest of the world immediately disowns you except for other homeless people. 

Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. I explain all this in my profile. 

?We're a bisexual sociopathic left-leaning, ambivalent evangelistic, reputable, onion-eating, fart-inhaling, necrocoprophilic extraterrestrial that is quasi-paranoid polyschizophrenic that normally ingests a cornucopia of various neuroleptic and serotonin re-uptake inhibitors to control the occasional and frequent bouts of paranoia and/or the emergence of on or more conflicting personality profiles. One of my most prominent and hostile personality profiles collects human earwax candles, scratches their butt with a belt sander, and likes to display their most recent boogers including the nasal hairs on 20" x 28" foamcore display boards and circling the boogers with the longest nasal hairs with bright yellow fluorescent marker. The most prominent personality is also able to recite the lyrics of Ina-Gadda-Da-Vida backwards while simultaneously inserting the words 'fuck' and 'piss' at random locations throughout the recital. 
Many other characteristics of the prominent personality including huffing gold spray paint and doing involuntary dental extractions on the local squirrel populace. 
The second most prominent personality that often appears with the first personality and threatens to kill it is predominately female and claims to hear the voices of Lesbian country-western singers commanding her to change the sandpaper on the first personality's belt sander to a much coarser grit, so the second personality may more easily harmonize her gruff and canine-like voice while singing David Allan Coe's popular country-western song,

The second personality's also enjoys dancing barefoot on broken beer bottle glass while snorting cocaine and masturbating to life-size cut-out of George Michael posing in pink spandex. 
The third and least personality is essentially a Zombie pothead that lacks any defining sexual or racial characteristics. The one and only most important thing to the third personality is constantly watching Cheech & Chong's movie, 'Up In Smoke' repeatedly. The third personality has only been known to utter two words, wow and man. The third personality is also in constant need of Visine, which it snorts and drinks, and Zig-Zag rolling papers. 
There are over a hundred or more personalities within us but they are either in transition of a recent alien abduction, serving as a constituent in Washington, D. C., or locked in your friendly neighborhood mental facility.

I have been calling the lady that I need to speak to all afternoon and apparently she is gone for the day and will get back to me first thing in the morning. So that is where we are at I guess. 

I'll let you know how it turns out though, 
Alex
I spoke this morning to the lady and found out that our timeline is basically the standard drop add period which expires this upcoming Monday. I'm taking my portion of the form to their office today so if you can fax your portion of the form today we can get the ball rolling. 

As far as a next appointment, I don't know what my schedule is yet so I guess just put me in that Monday slot and I'll let you know if that changes. 

Thanks for your help, 
Alex

Can you let me know when you do send it though, so I can proceed with my next step

Hi I spoke to you on the phone yesterday about the readmission process and was wondering how I can track the progress of everything and know when or if I can register etc. My doctor e-mailed me saying he faxed in his letter and I dropped off mine as well so I'm not sure how to further proceed.

There is very little literature available on the human crop maker. Where it does exist it is often critical to the point of scathing. It frequently portrays them as liars, shoddy artists or the agents of a conspiracy to discredit the genuine phenomenon. 
Three notable exceptions to the rule can still be tracked down. Jim Schabel admitted to his role as a circle maker in 2003's Round in Circles, whilst John Macnish went deeper - albeit as an outsider spending time with the circle makers - in the same year's Cropcircle Apocalypse. 
More recent is the 2006 edition of The Field Guide by Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg. It is the most revealing of the three titles, revealing much of the pair's philosophy as practicing circle makers. However, over lunch one summer afternoon in 2011, Irving put it to me that The Field Guide is no longer relevant; it is now an artifact of one team and their philosophy at a certain point in time. Things have moved on. 
Leading circle makers have parted from the scene, leaving a different generation behind. It is one that does not necessarily abide by a code of silence and is bereft, for the moment at least, of grand masters. Amongst its ranks are those who believe the circles are no more than aesthetic art, albeit that which is made in locations rife with paranormal activity. 
In short, the crop circle fraternity is a very different place to the one it was in 2006. As of 2013 both Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg had withdrawn from the fields except in cases of paid commissions. One rather cutting wit has described the current state of affairs as the 'end of days'. I do not share such a fully apocalyptic vision. We are talking crop circles as opposed to Dr Strangelove or On the Beach. But there are lessons to be learned from the past; some of which are not widely known. They demonstrate how and when a crop circle is most powerful.

crop circle challenge
http://www.lucypringle.co.uk/

To the general public crop circles frequently present a dichotomy. You either go with the true believers who are convinced the circles are made by extraterrestrials, or you side with the skeptics, often represented by the despised human circle makers. 
When I allowed myself to get close to the circles by relentlessly pursuing them around Wiltshire I naively believed this false dilemma. It took two and a half years to completely change my viewpoint. There is no big conflict of ideologies. Rather, there are possibilities. 
An area or pattern of flattened plants can become a venue for all kinds of paranormal or profound experiences. Researcher Lucy Pringle has noted people suffering from Parkinson's disease undergo temporary relief from their symptoms. Electronic equipment fails and animals display unusual behaviour. People from different walks of life are brought together when they would otherwise not meet. Children will lecture skeptical adults on why their doubt is ill founded. 
Overall, circles photographer Steve Alexander is not incorrect to call his website Temporary Temples; that is what the crop circles are. However, experiences do not necessarily take place without consideration as to how the crop circles appear. No matter anyone's view on paranormal involvement, the spectre of the human circle maker lurks in the shadows. 
There is very little literature available on the people who make crop circles. Where it does exist it is often critical to the point of scathing. It frequently portrays them as liars, shoddy artists or the agents of a conspiracy to discredit the genuine phenomenon. 
Three notable exceptions to the rule can still be tracked down. Jim Schabel admitted to his role as a circle maker in 2003's Round in Circles, whilst John Macnish went deeper - albeit as an outsider spending time with the circle makers - in the same year's Cropcircle Apocalypse. 
More recent is the 2006 edition of The Field Guide by Rob Irving and Jon Lundberg. It is the most revealing of the three titles, revealing much of the pair's philosophy as practicing circle makers. However, over lunch one summer afternoon in 2011, Irving put it to me that The Field Guide is increasingly irrelevant; it is now an artifact of one team and their philosophy at a certain point in time. Things have moved on. 
Leading circle makers have parted from the scene, leaving a different generation behind. It is one that does not necessarily abide by a code of silence and is bereft, for the moment at least, of grand masters. Amongst its ranks are those who believe the circles are no more than aesthetic art, albeit that which is made in locations rife with paranormal activity. 
In short, the crop circle fraternity is a very different place to the one it was in 2006. One rather cutting wit has described the current state of affairs as the 'end of days'. I do not share such a fully apocalyptic vision. We are talking crop circles as opposed to Dr Strangelove or On the Beach. But there are lessons to be learned from the past; episodes to be revisited by any circle maker who does not want to see the phenomenon collapse. They demonstrate the crop circle is most powerful when it is what Irving's former colleague Rod Dickinson described as 'the thing that propels the plot along, evoking a whole set of desires and beliefs and the promise of something bigger.' Often, that desire involves the attempts of individuals to place their own version of truth upon the matter of the circles' origins, purpose and meaning. 




'Perhaps one day it will revert to occasional, relatively small outbreaks in the vicinity of Warminster and the Wiltshire/Hampshire border, echoing a time, not so long ago, when an unassuming man saw magic in communion with our mystical landscapes and acted upon it.'

There is little available literature on the human crop circle maker. Where it does exist it tends to portray them in a negative light; typically as degenerate vandals or secret service agents out to draw attention away from the 'genuine' (extra-terrestrial made) phenomenon. 
Until I joined the ranks of the circle makers I had no idea how despised they were in some quarters. I have had my car tyres slashed and received anonymous hate e-mails. I have also had the pleasure of being called scum whilst leaving a UFO conference.
I would be disingenuous if I pleaded ignorance to the reasoning behind such vitriol. Plain truth is there are an awful lot of people who have attached their hopes, beliefs and preconceptions to the crop circle phenomenon.

I purchased your magnetic phone mount on July 26th and was reading reviews today that you started shipping a newer version that was more sturdy (less tremble) and had sent it to the customer free of charge. I was wondering if the version I received was the original version or the 2nd version.

Goodbye London universities, hello university of Dundee 
so shit

@What_the_hob thankyou Alice :) it means a lot now, I'm just so so annoyed with myself
I'm probably gonna start soon. 
@What_the_hob AAB is just what I want for St Andrews! I'm just so worried I won't get it now. Can you just come over for a hug?
@What_the_hob thankyou for this :) and you're not but ok! 
@What_the_hob I'm just so worried St Andrews will look at these and not even consider me 
How'd you do?
im a fucking failure

Such a fucking failure
I'm now kinda hoping @StAndrewsCS value my work at various companies as well as my AS grades...
Screw exams and tests I have real work experience #IBM #GCHQ 
@StAndrewsCS So long as I can get predicted and attain AAB then I should be in a good position? How much do re-sits factor in? Thanks!
@StAndrewsCS thank you for your help, I may be emailing soon! 
I think being at work today has helped me relax and calm down after this morning 
That's quite good! What I would try and put more emphasis on us why universities might want me and stress those reasons. Its ok if it's more than a small paragraph as it's down to my housemaster to whittle it down to fit and pick the best bits which I do whiff him. But again very good

There are things worse then kids doing that. If they graduate school that's all that matters. They got issues and they have parents who should be helping can't blame them if there parents aren't doing shit about it. 
Don't hate the curious kids. Make a status about the middle schoolers parents. 
You're pointing out the wrong source of people here
Right that's not the kids fault for listening to that is it? Can't blame them. Can't blame them for living in this type of society. 
Right that's not the kids fault for listening to that is it ? They weren't here long enough to make that type of music popular. Can't blame them. Can't blame them for living in this type of society either. 
You can't blame them for ruining society just cause. You can't jump to conclusion that when they become adults and graduate that they'll continue doing 
You can't blame them for ruining society when they haven't even done anything. It may be your opinion that they will but you can't confront them of it when they haven't had a chance. 
So in the end all you can do is give them a chance cause even if the economy
There's also a thing called giving chances and not stereotyping a group of kids. Cause in the end there kids and your opinion or anyone else's won't stop 
Yeah! And okayyy :/ 
There's also a thing called giving chances and not stereotyping a group of kids. Cause in the end there kids. I'm not agreeing that's right but you just can't say cause they do that they'll ruin whatever you said they would. Kinda a stretch there

Cause I may have an idea on how your feeling cause there was a time that I was doing the same thing you could be doing to yourself and what helped me get out of a bad habit like self harming was really opening up and telling anyone you can trust with anything about how and why you feel the way you feel.. this could've been really random but just knowing how bad it feels to harm yourself you don't want other people feeling the same way but I just wanted to know if I could maybe help

I know exactly how you feel like you feel like if you told them they'd make fun of you or think your crazy or something but if you tell him everything and why he'll be really worried I'm sure he really cares about you so if you talked to him about it he'd want to help you in anyway. It took me so long to tell anyone and what I found out is the longer you keep all the things that are making you feel this way bottled up the worse it gets. Maybe right now you don't feel like you want to but if things start feeling worse talk to Abel about it or anyone that's understanding. In sorry your going through things like this

Belly button but that's only cause I'm not a fan of nipple piercings. But you should get what you want! Are you leaning towards one?
Well, it's really what you want that matters. A lot of it depends on the style of piercing as well like if it's decorative, or a ring or barbell. It's what will make you happy :)
Well I don't know, this salad is pretty yummy ;) jk jk
I'm funny. I'm sure you're better than a salad ;)

Oh not too bad. I kinda want to start walking to and from work. It'd be about a 20-25 min walk. But that would conflict with being lazy.

I was thinking going back to Frankie's could be fun but it's not close to ardesia (I'm cool with taking the subway tho). Or we could always cook yummy stuff altho my place is a mess and I forgot to take the trash out last night. What do y'all think?

I'd love to hear back from you and chat sometime :)

Lol, so what's up? :)
Lol no I stuck through to the end! We hit like 9 floors of Joe west, and all the threw story bricks 
Hey :)
it was pretty good!
Sorta! I met the other people on my floor and the people around my dorm :P

Its actually all pretty great! And the meal plan works this weekend Cuz the semester hasn't started yet!
Yes I do. If you look where I normally kept the games under my desk, there should be a red case that says "bioshock infinite" I think it has a picture of kind of like a mechanical bird on it.
If you open the case and push it open past like, flat, the plastic casing that holds the cover in while pop up, you just need to flip the cover around and then you can return it!
Oh God :P how's that?
Well hey Aaron christiansen is pretty cool! 
But thank God for food. The greatest awkward party filler ever. "so who do you know here?" "well, in, the food..."
So my Asian roommate just sits on his computer and plays league of legends. Like any down time he has he does that. Till like 2 in the morning! The dude is a machine!
kitty!
Right? Its great! Well, there's the girl I met at orientation but I haven't actually seen her since then. And then there's a couple of girls that I met when like everybody from my floor, went to every other floor and all the other buildings and met everybody
But Idk. The choices are bitchy white girls or satan's...
Asians* although I suppose there's a few satan's here too!
Yeah we do! Like a huge one! 
Haha yeah I'll be sure to come back with some stories! Its actually working pretty well, I just need to grab a cable box from the tech center tomorrow and I'm all good! But I get the history channel on analog so that's good

You up? 
What time are you going to open house? 
Yeah. 
Although really it'll only slow us down because then Alaina and Sam won't be able to get there. Its be easier if we stayed at your current house or we all stayed at our own houses. 
And then we just met in the morning. 
Yeah but isn't it really far away? 
Well we could all meet there, right? Because now Alaina and Sam will have to wake up like 2 hours early. 
Oh he's half an hour the other way. Okay that makes way more sense now okay. 
Okay. 
I'm going to the night one. I've got driving today. 
I could maybe just go to alainas in the morning and you guys could pick me and her up at the same time. 
Okay. I gtg I'll talk later. 
I would guess the night one wince you have reversal, right? 
Hey sorry I was driving. 
The night one. 
Sorry didn't hear the first text. 
You don't have anything to be sorry about. You need a ride, its as simple as that. 
And its not like you're way out of the way of where we're going regardless. 
What's the matter? 
I've got time. 
She says she's only nice to nice people. Told you she loves you. 
:)
So what's going on today that's so bad? 
We aren't going to be able to get to the one at 4 so I guess I'll pick you up at 5. 
Or I'll see you there or whatever we're doing. 
If you get a camera issue like op, ignore it. The phone is great and I've had it for months with no issues at all. Sure, there's always a bad egg, but no company can help that. Op should just be glad it didn't explode like some bad egged samsung phones. 
Yay for reps! 
Well that's bullshit. Verizon gets worse in my book every day. 
Busy right now, what do you need? 
May I'm busy right now sorry. I've gotta get a passport and then I've got to go to open house.

Still not getting whatever you send.

Alright. But seriously, don't switch :)

Yeah that's the plan at some point. I just don't know when or how because they I a no idea at all. Like they think I want to he a graphic designer. Little bit of a difference there.

Hey
Were you sleeping? 
Well I'm not anymore, but I got grounded because I was confused about where something goes because it's been there as long as I can remember but my mom told me it doesn't go there and I was trying to tell her that that's where it always has been and I didn't know where else to put it then she went berserk and called me a smartass and said I was taking back and grounded me. 
Yes I was Saturday and yesterday. 
Oh you mean being a smartass. No. 
I was trying to stay as calm as I could and she went crazy. She's been like that for 3 days though so I think she'd on her period or something. 
I know, right? 
And now tonight they're making me go to a cubs game of all things. 
Are you busy today, though? 
So instead of emailing me like I asked in the thing to the marines, they sent a fucking package with a note inside saying I'm too young to enlist. I'm like "no shit, I specifically asked for into on go who qualify for nrotc. And a simple email would have sufficed. " my parents didn't open it though so they still don't know, they probably think it's recruiting spam or something. But still, come on. A fucking letter? 
*info on how to qualify 
Yeah. So that's annoying. I'll show you it the next time you're over. Speaking of which, do you wanna come over after school tomorrow? 
Saturday? 
Si o no? 
And you're like 100000000% sure that there is absolutely no way you could go to the concert, correct?

So I'm not the correct age to enlist yet, but I want more info on what I need academically in order to qualify for NROTC. In the message, I specifically said the email if at all possible. Instead, they mailed me a giant pamphlet/packet saying I was underage to enlist... As if I didn't know that? 

So, on that note, can any of you guys provide me with some info on what I need academically to get into nrotc? I'm currently a sophomore in high school and I'm taking no honors classes, since at my school even the regular classes are college prep classes. I tried some honors classes last year, but my teachers didn't particularly like me

I'm currently a sophomore in high school and I'm taking no honors classes, since at my school even the regular classes are college prep classes. I tried some honors classes last year, but my teachers didn't particularly like me, so I ended up getting a gpa lower than what I would have if I didn't take any. I also signed up for all of this year's classes before I even decided to become a Marine, so it isn't like I just decided to slack off an try to slide into NROTC... If I need to take honors classes junior year, I can work my ass off as much as possible and the to get a decent gpa, but I still have a feeling that I would do better without honors classes. All of this on top of working my ass off to get more on shape. 

Kind of a cluster fuck, I know, but any help is much appreciated.

Yeah I know. I don't want to since it'll be awkward but still like its shinedown... 
Fuck it I'll see them some other tour. 
When is the game? 
Okay I'll be there I guess. 
Do you like get to stop early and leave if you want to? Like after your section is done or something? 
Oh is there an actual game? 
So when do you get to go home? 
Are you kidding me? We could totally make it! 
The concert starts at 7. By the time we got there skillet probably wouldn't even be done! 
Damn it! 
There is no game it's just a schrimmage. 
Damn it! What are you doing after?

Hey I don't know if you're still doing whatever you said you were doing after cheer but if you can, please reply to this. I need to talk with you tonight if at all possible. 
The navigation is great. Also, the gps only will kill your battery if you leave it on all the time. I have mine set to only turn it on if I have maps open and to turn it off when maps isn't open. This isn't a feature that comes with the phone, but I used an app called automateit to do that as well as other cool automations. 

So, long story short, yes, the navigation is great and gps is great if you use it right and don't leave it on, because, lets be honest. No matter what phone you have, gps always being on will rape your battery.

Reddit enhancement suite fixes that issue for me. 
So... 
Hey. 
... 
Skype? 
So I just saw my first tv ad. 
I think it's actually much better than the ones we saw on youtube. They definitely did something because it really did make me want to at least look up htc. Props to them! 
No...? 
Oh why not? 
Then get hangouts! Valid reasons yay! 
Okay... Sorry. 
I'm sorry I'm confused. You can't what? And how was I on your back? I was just messing around. 
Sorry. 
Okay see you later. Sorry if I made you mad. 
Hey man of you're still up I need some help really quick. 
Hey. 
I can't talk about what I wanted to talk about last night right now, but 
I can't talk about what I wanted to talk about last night right now, but I can later. 
So what's up? 
You busy tonight? 
Just browsing the frontpage like normal... One of the rare crashes I ever have. 
It did that to mine at first too, but it seemed to just be sprint. It cleared up after about an hour. 
Sorry, but your entire post is completely wrong. Htc has had the 4.2.2 update out for months, it's the carriers that are causing you to not have the update yet. It has nothing to do with htc. Also, as for your camera issues, make sure you are focusing on the darker parts if you want a more even light across the picture, or focus on the object you are trying to get a picture of if you don't care what the background participants looks like. 
If you are having really light usage, kernel will always be the top because that's simply the android phone running. If there are no other apps that are constantly running, it will always be the top. 
If you are having really light usage, kernel will always be the top because that's simply the android phone running. If there are no other apps that are constantly running, it will always be the top. Also, is everything you listed in the first paragraph over 4G? Because that will kill the battery on any phone.

That's like the same setup I'm going to get sometime soon except with some aesthetics changes and an x60!
Well there are other things to consider like me literally not having $4 to spare. Crazy, I know, but when you have to save up for like your own food and bills and pc upgrades and gaben shrines, you really can't spare anything. (the last 2 were sarcasm, in case you may have took those seriously.)
If anyone's got a bf3 key, I'd really appreciate it. I'm trying to see how my current shit rig will run it to estimate the upgrades I'll need to do. Anything else you feel like throwing in there that you don't want would be cool, too! Thanks!

Okay who's jolly rancher? 
This was just last night. 
Obviously the way she said that implies she's mad about something, but I have literally no idea what I did to make her mad. 
Well that was the convo so I'll send you a different one. 
Okay. 
Oh yeah okay. 
Forgot sorry. 
But just to clarify, jolly rancher is a code name for someone of the female gender, correct? 
Or tonight if we all skype or something. 
Oh wait her skype doesn't work.

Alright, I'll be sure to email you again in February! Thank you! 
So my mom saw the letter from the marines so I guess technically now she knows. And exactly what I expected happened. 
The first thing she says is "no offence, but I can't even get you to go running or listen to me." well maybe if she stopped being an irrational bitch I would listen to her more than I do, which I already 99% of the time without question. 
So yeah they don't have my support as of now. Wonderful. 
Well they have nothing to do with carriers, so it's not their fault if they don't push it to your tmobile phone because they have no control over that other than pushing and prying the carrier until they push it out. 
Let's hope he has android manager, because otherwise the phone might be on silent or vibrate. 
Well they still have to turn it on in device administrators. 
Those are all for the navy. At ether the same? Sorry to be a bother... 
Or I mean I don't have their support. Except they seem to have talked and seem more open to the idea now and are talking politics which is good I guess. 
Well I did that which is why I came here because there are actual guys who went through it here. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or something. 
Well no company can anywhere in the us. No company other than apple has been able to get past carriers and the only reason apple can is because they threw a fuckton of money at the carriers. 
Oh I didn't know what prey was. My bad! 
1234
Oh, I thought it was for everything. 
Well I got a lot of mixed answers which is why I came here. There varying answers from grades not battering to get into nrotc all the way to needing a 5 gpa to get in. 
Htc one mini should be out in a couple weeks and is great for people coming from ios. 
Make sure that the battery is working fine. It should take about 2 hours to fully charge and should get about 4-5 hours of screen time in stock. Open the camera app and make sure it isn't laggy. Also place it down on a flat surface face up with the camera open. It should be black or almost black. If there's any pink or purple that isn't on the surface it is on, the camera is defective, replace the phone immediately. Make sure there are no noticeable gaps in the construction and there aren't any scratches or dents anywhere on the device. Turn on the screen and open a picture of a solid color, such as hot pink, that covers the entire screen. Make sure there aren't any dead pixels anywhere on the screen. Play some music on the phone and make sure both speakers work and don't have any popping or crackling sounds. 

If it passes all those tests and it seems as fast as you would expect, it should be good! 
Put it in airplane mode to see if any syncs are causing the issue for some reason. Also, please list every app installed on the phone. 
Put it in airplane mode to see if any syncs are causing the issue for some reason. Also, please list every app downloaded to the phone. 
Alright thanks! Also, I've heard that some won't even look at you no matter what your gpa is if you don't have any honors classes. Is this true? Because I tried some honors classes last year and I ended up getting a lower gpa than it I didn't take them. My parents said it was like college level curriculum that they were teaching us, and I was only a freshman!

Hey 
Nova docks

I've never seen it. Are you on a custom ROM? 
Sorry but quick question. If I'm testing your app, why do I have a trial time? I only have 14 days to help make your app better? I hope this countdown thing doesn't actually do anything or else it's not even worth it to test since I don't have money to spend and Google play music covers all my needs other than customization... 
Weird. I got nothing, sorry. 
This often happens when expqnding
This often happens when clicking on a comment to show options below it and then unclicking those options. Has been going on for a while, but I never got the chance to screenshot it. 
Also, it seems that imgur albums sometimes refuse to load in the in app browser, so I have to click the little browser button and open them in chrome, which is mildly annoying. 
That's what I was hoping to hear!

I definitely won't pass it up. I'm trying to find time to talk to a recruiter but I want to get more in shape first. Also, some options have said you practically have to be in a varsity sport. Is this true, and does speech team count? 
I'm also in viperrom, so I don't think it has to do with the ROM.

I'm 15 and I still can't because my parents are afraid my brothers will get their hands on it (11 and 8). 
Hard reset. I don't know how to do it on that phone, but it's stuck in a bootloop. Google how to hard reset the phone. 
I swear to god siblings are such pains in the ass. 
So my parents found out I want to be a marine. I didn't exactly tell them, but they found a marines thing and asked why I had it so I kinda just told them. Better later than never I guess.

Not aloud in the shop to see your own truck? If it were me, they wouldn't be getting my money. But since it is all taken apart already then it does make sense to wait for them to just finish it. Seriously though, not letting someone see the work being done to their own truck? I can't even comprehend that. 
So packkkk

Gotta say, I feel pretty b.a. like this
It's the rims. Put something better than those on and a lot more people would like it. 

However, it's pretty clear you don't exactly care what everyone else likes and instead build what you like. Tough way to make money but it seems to work for you. Nice work, enjoy it!
Um, no info? Thanks, so much...

Wear it if you want if not don't 
Lol like the other dress better
The one you wore in calgary
i gotta study show your boobs ass i no care 

no fucks

How little I care about your dilema 
I'm blocking you if you send one more text 
And your blocked till tonight 
munc
Munc
Seriously Mankirat stop
I need my phone for texts from other people in not blocking you but your clothing issues are of little concern 
I told you wear whatever you want as long as your okay with it if it makes YOU feel slutty don't wear it your an adult start acting like one 
You've been asking me for over 40 mins I'm not angry just trying to get my point across
It takes me 3 mind to decide what to wear its not hard if I can do it 
I got through 3 free lance videos each is about 10 mins 
30 approximately 
My mistake 
Its okay don't be sad daddy still loves you hahahahhah
Man I feel so bad for some reason of I ever say anything to you in always feeling bad even though I feel I'm right 
Sorry. 
Your not the only one to blame? 
True true you are right it's more my fault. 
I could have ended the entire thing had I commented on the massage 
So what you decide on lol hahaha
Is that so I guess that top wasn't to short for you lol. 
Lol
I would think so 
High hormone 
Eating taking break
Yeap yeap 
I got 
I got bored of not having boobs 
So I got super fat 
Yeap
Nope
Now I have enough for the both of us because yours are not enough to suffice their nice but not big enough 
Dammit I really liked them :(
How do you know they will grow
Lol I'm happy with what they are. 
I care about proportionality. 
Drafts
You know I still think you deserve better when it comes to me it's sad but its true 
Babies for boobs 
I don't know don't you yourself think you deserve someone better I just screw things up all the time and I don't really do much for you at all. 
Just say stupid things 
Like today 
But don't you feel I do it so often like there have to be multiple occasions where I did that to you. 
No but in general of I did this that means I must have done this multiple times just because I know if I've done it once I've done it before 
What would they be. 
I think I kind of put you on a pedestal and just am oblivious to your mistakes and then knit pick on my own. 
I have alot of insecurities I don't know if it does come accrued but I do have them I don't know if they'll ever be gone 
I'm scared of being with you 
Because I could hurt you
Cheat on you break your heart lie to you 
I know I never do on purpose but there's so many different situations where you get hurt
I know but that's what I mean if I do I'm scared to lose you because I'd want you to just say bye to 
I'm not saying I will but do you think that we have alot more to lose by being a couple than if we were just friends. 
Why would you just not wanna be friends 
I'm sorry I didn't know I meant that much to you 
If somehow hypothetically you cheated on me what would you like me to do. 
Instead of me just saying bye. 
But then see you said it would hurt you in so scared of being with you if it meant hurting you in any way 
But I don't ever wanna do that. 
I'd be okay with being hurt but I never wanna hurt anybody. 
I know your not but I don't ever wanna see you get hurt and just by being with you I take that chance. 
I could still be your bestfriend 
Why not?
You could still come to me with all your problems and still confide in me. 
I would be happy if the guy were in my opinion better than me. 
I'm scared that's why I'm doing this 
That was me offering a young naive girl some advice that she needed in febuary 
February
Yes I love being with you it always makes my day better even if we just sit together and don't talk 
Even when we cuddle 
Even when your not on my mind I still wanna be with you 
I love how you stress over the little things and come to me and you realize how simple the problem was. 
I love how you care so much about execution and how you assume the best about people. 
I love how you try acquiring to overcome your fears or anything that discomforts you when your with me 
I love how you randomly smile sometimes out of the blue. 
I can go on and again I just realized if you try and conquer your fears and whatever makes you uncomfortable I should do the same. 
I saved that as a reminder just invade I ever have doubts or feel insecure I'll remember everything about you. :)

Hi Yin. Just sent 150 downpayment 
Version: 1.0 RC17 (17)
OS: 4.3
Model: Nexus 4

Just wanted to comment on how great an app I think this is.

Used Tasker and Llama extensively but at the end of the day, its too much trouble with logic and the interface is just ugly.

The simplicity and design of your apps are really great. Sometimes less is more.

Just a few comments, firstly for the Sleep Agent would be nice if white listed calls go through. I like the implementation of other companies where a double call within a given time will allow the call to go through. The white list would also be nice if I could just select all contacts or favorites from the address book.

Secondly, would be great to have an Agent for silence during meetings. Something that integrates with Google calendar.

Finally, integration with NFC Task Launcher would be great. For example activating Sleep Agent with NFC would be great for naps.

Please keep up the great work. Personally I would pay for individual Agent functions (kind of like a mini android market)

Winston
Thanks Joshua

I believe there is greater potential from managing diversity in Asia for American companies and that I am the solution. Many companies cover the Japan-Asia Pacific (?JPAC?) as one region and I believe my unique background gives me an opportunity to maximize the benefits of diversity for American companies.
Kaori: explain clearly why you need MBA and want to be admitted to Harvard.

My father?s career had a profound impact to my life. My father is an Cantonese immigrant to the US and worked in two companies during his career. As an auditor and later consultant at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in the US and Japan and as CFO and later CEO at Microsoft in Japan and later Singapore. He set up the Asia Pacific Operations Center in Singapore to manage the Asia Pacific Region including Japan. 
Kaori: this does not explain why your father?s job impacted your life. Is geo or his career path?

I am no stranger to diversity. My parents immigrated from Taiwan and Hong Kong as first generation Americans. I have grown up in America, Japan and Singapore and received 8 years of experience in the Japanese local school system. My career has been centered around American and Japanese clients in the US, Japan and Asia Pacific. I currently work at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in the corporate advisory department, where 14 professionals from 8 different countries and professional backgrounds co-exist.

I realized that in Asia, cultures do not ?integrate? but instead ?co-exist? as there are deep seated prejudice that exist for cultural and historical reasons such as the Japanese occupation of many Asian countries. This creates the ?Us vs Them? mentality which can lead to conflict. However, I believe that conflict in a controlled environment can lead to a greater pool of ideas, which can drive innovation.

My upbringing has provided me with the background required for managing the Japan-Asia Pacific region. Firstly, I speak the language of the region, English, Japanese and Chinese. Secondly, I have a cultural understanding of the region from my education, important where a significant portion of communication consists of non-verbal cues. Finally my upbringing has given me cultural neutrality where I am not easily ?labeled? into any culture group.

As my father used to tell me ?communication? and ?understanding? is the key to management in the JPAC region. This is not only within the region but most importantly to the head office located in America. I believe that due to my upbringing, I am in a even better position than my father to take on a similar role but I do not only want to follow in his footsteps but bring diversity in Asia to the next level. 

This is the reason I am interested in business school education. As a soon to be father, the risk for my family in this difficult economy, the lost income, disruption in career and geographical relocation are huge. In Asia, there is an emphasis on practical skills and an MBA program at times is seen as too theoretical. However, I strongly believe in business school as it is from my experience that the greatest learning comes from the experiences of others and Harvard?s emphasis on the case method is consistent with my beliefs.

As much as I hope to learn from the experiences of other students, I believe my unique background and experiences are also a valuable addition to the class. Thank you for considering my application.

Hello.

I would just like to follow up with another question.

One of my recommending has completed the recommendation on the PDF format but couldn't submit because I have not finished the application.

I understand that a completed recommendation can be transfered to the new online system. Could the content of this incomplete application be transferred as well?

If not I would need to request him to copy and paste to the new online link?

Thank you

"Good morning Sister." Scanty said, yawning politely into her palm as she entered the dining room, garnering an absent minded nod from Kneesocks, her focus primarily on the laptop sitting before her. Scanty peered over her sister's shoulder, attempting to get a glimpse of what her sister was so interested in, but Kneesocks swiftly shut the lid of the device. Scanty let the subject lie, but internally her curiosity had been piqued. Both of the sisters had always made a point of sharing everything with each other, no matter how insignificant or private the matter might seem. This sudden secrecy was both irritating and disquieting.

"Good morning, Scanty-Sama, Kneesocks-Chan." Cloak said as he glided in shortly behind Scanty.

The honorifics Cloak used were another source of suspicion. 'Sama' being the equivalent of the English prefix 'Mrs', while 'Chan' was generally applied to one who was familiar with the speaker, roughly the same as calling someone a 'Friend' in the English language. The implications seemed quite clear to Scanty, though if her sister realized as such, she made no attempts to dissuade Cloak, even as he sat next to her at the table, his back to Scanty and the two began to converse in hushed tones.

As the pair continued to speak, Scanty's extremely short temper began to wear thin.

#;#;#

"I trust you slept well last night, Kneesocks-Chan?" Cloak asked, moving his hood slightly so that she could better see his face, though he was careful not to remove the hood entirely, not with Scanty in the room.

Kneesocks blushed, smiling slightly, "As well as could be expected after all that occurred yesterday."

Cloak frowned, "My apologizes, perhaps it would have been better if I had waited longer. Is there anything I can do that I might make amends?"

Kneesocks waved him off, "Think nothing of it. Sleep lost is nothing to fret over." She gasped as Cloak gently grabbed her hand.

"I insist, Kneesocks-Chan." Cloak replied, grinning, a mischievous glint in his eye.

"W-well, if you must," Kneesocks began, blushing, "I'd appreciate it if you would accompany me and assist in scouting out the area for the first phase of our next move against the Angels."

Cloak nodded, "Of course, it would be my pleasure." With that he repositioned his hood as Scanty approached them.

"How did you find your accommodations Cloak? I trust they were up to par?" Scanty asked, and Cloak nodded.

"Yes. I must say, you certainly have a talent for interior decoration." He noted.

"Thank you, though I haven't the faintest idea how you came to the conclusion that I had a hand in that."

"Humor me, Scanty-Sama. I have my sources. But nevertheless, I must be on my way." He stood, turning to Kneesocks. "When you are ready to depart, I will be waiting in the parking lot. Until then, Ji Su."

Scanty and Kneesocks watched as the mysterious demon took his leave, before finally Scanty turned on her sister, her agitation showing plainly on her face.

"What is going on with you two?" She questioned, malice dripping from her tone, "You have never hidden things from me before!"

Kneesocks' eyes widened at her sister, before an anger took hold. "Well, as the saying goes, there is a first time for everything, dear sister." She stood, packing her laptop away. Scanty jerked back as if physically attacked, stunned by her sister's words. Perhaps she was going about this the wrong way.

"Kneesocks!" Scanty cried, but if Kneesocks had heard the tone of her sister's voice, she did not acknowledge it as she quickly left the dining room.

#;#;#

Kneesocks found Cloak exactly where he had said he would be, standing by a parked Shelby Mustang GT 500. She smiled and waved without thinking about it, and he nodded. She noticed the faint glow of a cigarette coming from within his hood, before he smothered it and tossed the butt into a nearby trashcan.

"Old habit, helps dull the pain." He apologized, holding the door open for her, "You OK?"

"Fine... Let's just get going."

"Right." He replied, closing her door and moving over to the driver's side, getting in and starting the engine. He quickly maneuvered them out of the parking lot and before long they were speeding down the highway into Daten City proper. Cloak looked around the car, checked the mirrors, nodded, and pulled down his hood. Eye focused on the road, he spoke.

"You need to vent?" He asked, and Kneesocks sighed.

"It's Scanty." She began, "After you left she rounded on me, she thinks I'm hiding things from her, that there's something going on between us."

"Is there?" Cloak asked simply.

"Anything I am hiding anything or is something going on with us?"

"Both." Cloak replied, turning off the highway as they neared their destination.

"I was doing a little fact checking regarding your story last night, and I didn't want Scanty to find out from anyone but you." Kneesocks replied, blushing.

"Fair enough." He turned to her, about to ask about the latter, before noticing they had arrived. Cloak once again raised his hood, hiding his scars from the world.

#;#;#

Following Kneesocks up to the roof of the building, Cloak now found himself kneeling alongside her, gazing around on lookout while Kneesocks analyzed the area before them through high powered binoculars.

"Our plan is simple, but effective. A party is being hosted by the city to celebrate the Angels' work to keep the city ghost free, as well as to announce that there has been a record breaking number of days without ghosts. There will be drinks, junk food and an overall lack of order." Kneesocks said, not looking away from the scene, making mental notes to keep this section doubly blockaded, retooling the plan to account for an area that would be more effort to block than it was worth. "That is when we strike. We will release a few infected into the crowd, and once the other guests succumb to the infection, the Angels won't stand a chance."

"Should we really base that much of the plan on the infected? As far as I can tell, they do not have very advanced intelligence. Suppose they were to escape containment?" Cloak responded, pulling down his hood and setting his piercing gaze on Kneesocks.

"They are trained to listen to our orders, and besides, they are nothing compared to our strength." Kneesocks assured him, turning back to the plaza below. Her eyes widened as she noticed something. She cursed under her breath. Cloak spotted it too.

Forming in the center of the plaza was a massive feral dog ghost, it's teeth bigger than it's own head.

"If anyone spots that ghost, the gathering will be canceled! We have to take it out, now!" Kneesocks said urgently, transforming her scythes and jumping from the roof to the ground six stories below. Cloak followed her closely, but before she could begin her attack, he stepped in front of her.

"Kneesocks-Chan, let me handle this." He pulled up his hood, "You just enjoy the show." He leapt into the air, bringing a heavy kick down on the beasts head, crushing it into the floor, before grabbing it by the scruff of it's neck and, with a grunt of exertion, flung the massive ghost into the air. He leapt again, punching and kicking at the airborne beast as it soared helplessly through the air. With a final kick he sent the ghost crashing to the ground again, where it began to dissolve, black blood hissing as it drained from the beast.

Cloak landed near Kneesocks in a crouch, before turning to Kneesocks, bowing. "Thank you, you've been a great crowd!"

The ghost wasn't done with them just yet though. It had just enough strength left to swing a massive paw, claws like giant scythes, at Kneesocks. She screamed and braced for the coming impact.

"Cloak!"

The crushing blow never came, and after Kneesocks realized this, she opened her eyes. Cloak had blocked the blow with Jormungandr, but the ghost was still trying to crush them both, and the strain of keeping the larger creature from flattening them both was quickly becoming harder to endure.

"No you don't!" Cloak growled, pushing back, the scars on his face beginning to bleed from the exertion, "Kneesocks-Chan, get out of here! I can't hold him back much longer!"

"But-!" Cloak cut her off before she could continue.

"Don't worry about me, just get out of here!"

Biting her lip, she nodded and ran. Just as she got to the building they had been looking around from such a short time ago, she turned to see Cloak disappear beneath the ghost's claws in a cloud of dust and rubble.

"CLOAK!"

Tears in her eyes, she ran at the ghost, scythes whirling, but the ghost had regenerated, as if it hadn't fought at all. She sliced and diced, but the beast's second wind failed to die down. With a swipe of its claws, Kneesocks was sent flying through a wall, rubble pinning her down. Stalking towards its prey, the ghost seemed to chuckle, a noise like air being let out of a balloon, but distorted. It raised a paw to finish the job...

"Don't touch her."

#;#;#

To say Cloak was pissed off would be an understatement. To say he was ready to tear the demon before gum limb from limb was much more accurate. He absentmindedly glanced at the oversized scythe that had formed on its own as his blood dripped onto Jormungandr. As he gazed at it, a name floated around in his head, as if someone was whispering into his ear.

The Dark Scythe, Hel.

It was a nasty looking device, with a serrated edge colored a deep crimson, the steel of the blade, like the handle a dark black. It seemed to be emitting barely audible whispers that burrowed into his mind, promises of power and blood running like rivers. He ignored them, Jormungandr had done the same at first, before an agreement had been reached. If he lived through the next few hours he would open negotiations, but until then the weapon would have to make do.

Responding to his earlier thoughts on how he wished to shred the ghost before him like so much confetti, the scythe let out a screech as two more blades formed on either side of the blade, the new blades a translucent, almost crystalline blood red. Yelling out in rage, Cloak swung the scythe at the ghost, cleanly cleaving both front paws in one strike. The beast yelped in pain and, no longer able to support itself, fell face first against the ground.

Cloak wasn't done yet, though.

Sprinting at the dog, he leapt onto its nose, and from there to the top of its skull. He pulled the dark scythe back, its blade glowing red with bloodlust, before plunging the blade through the ethereal being's brain. Unable to take further abuse, the ghost's body collapsed on itself, melting into a oily sludge which shrieked and evaporated in the setting sun.

Cloak ran to Kneesocks, digging her carefully out of the rubble.

"Are you OK, Kneesocks-Chan?!" He asked, pulling back his hood, his eye frantically scanning her body for injury.

"I'm fine, no ghost is powerful enough to even scratch a high class demon such as myself." She replied, taking Cloak's proffered hand regardless. "Though something disturbs me. Ghosts do not attack unless ordered by the one who summoned them, but my sister and I are supposed to be the only ones in Daten who can do so."

"Meaning this wasn't just a rogue ghost." Cloak said, frowning as he gazed at the scythe still in his hand. "Someone sent that ghost to kill us."

The monsters move between thoughts. Long ago our ancestors fought this. They gave us the ability to understand. It has been lost with time, unfortunately. Although, some say, when we see movement out of the corner of our eyes or something that looks out of place (such as the aforementioned flicker of motion) its our brain reacting to them. The ability has been lost. The reflex is still as alive as ever.

If you find diets too hard. Just start by eating less. Don't jump in the deep end immediately. It helps if you start off slow so your body can get used to it.

Honestly, as much as I love flesky, the autocorrect doesn't hold a candle to SwiftKey. I don't know why but it kills me how bad it is. 

Actually, it would be better to say it's like it relies on the number of letters in a word instead of its similarity to the correct word. 

For example 

The word "candle" 

Swiftkey: I spell candl it corrects to candle

Flesky: candl corrects to canal 

It's really what stops me from using it.

There sure is but try telling record companies that. 
A major app that is widely used goes through a major redesign. That's pretty big. 
Probably has something to do with copyright. Don't blame Google for a industry that refuses to come out of the cave.

Someone should tell this lady not every guy who helps you out wants to date you bwhahahaha. 
^ yes!
I wasn't even trying to hit on her, nor did I want to lol. But I have heard women bicker chivalry is dead. Maybe it's because they don't say thank to ppl who open doors for them. 
I thought you were excited to see the buffet line we are planning to have?

Visions of johan
3/3 or 3/4
Hmm. Is the melody going to be country ish or no? 
Progression won't be. That's the progression for the majority of country, blues, and rock songs. 
That's what I'm thinking for everything. Have a pretty normal country song with different instruments and then just mess it up note by note 
Folk is an acoustic guitar. Blues is a guitar bass and drums. Country is a fiddle, banjo, guitars, drums, bass, lap steel, piano... 
From that lesson with country music? 
Yes

I wouldn't say it's as good as Continuum, but I do like it a lot. One thing I hate about it is the awful production on it. Also, I think it was rushed which is why John doesn't like a lot of it.

I noticed that when Hank walked in to talk to Jesse in the beginning of the episode, he turned off the camera. When Saul came in to talk to Jesse, he pressed the power button and turned the camera (thinking that he turned it off). This means the camera picked up everything that was said between Saul and Jesse. The recording could be the evidence Hank needs.

If God were into poetry 
He'd write of the beauty in pollution 
Speak of the hatred in humans 
Bask in the innocence of choosing 
Give up in search of solution 
Stick all of creation in institution 
He would make me 

If God was just a piano 
And I was the notes he played 
You'd be given all of the black ones 
And I would play away 



If God was just a pilot 
And a carpenter was just a tool 
We'd cruise control into the clouds 
And I'd come right home to you 

What God would think of today's modernization 

Who God is.... Government 
The people 

?First thing a guy comes and I shot him with a pistol and ran into an abandoned warehouse bedroom thing. Emily is there and we jump on the connected bunk beds. Then a kid runs through and we keep trying to stealthily take pictures until finally the kid surprises us and crawls up the ladder. It became somewhat of a real like odd objective civ game between Emily and I. Me and the little girl flew from the bed and were up high and then Emily caught up. She looked at me and I said that I have a kid with me she can't win this way, she didn't care. She dropped me and the baby to the ground and won. Zoomed out shot of us falling and then victory music played. I woke up. 

I tried to go back into the dream with a friend but jumped in at the wrong time in the replay. I waited in the warehouse and was shot. 

Tried again and killed that man and waited for the girl. A man came up and asked where someone was with a gun pointed at us. We were confused. We didn't know. He shot us. 

Next time there was that guy in the bunk bed. We saw him up there and had a pistol. We shot him and stabbed him. A 16 year old boy came out and started stabbing. I ran and he caught up to me and jabbed me in the back a few times. Then I woke up. 

What if they were all the same family. The girl innocent.

Hola 
I'm patiently waiting for the new episode... 
. 
That's fine. And its not that long I don't think. Each part is really short 
screeeenshott
Okay @@

texting games 

But still... I'll catch up with you. Tonight's episode.... Felt like the shortest thing that I ever watched. And pretty much only 5 minutes actually mattered. There were too many story lines being shown for it to move anywhere. 
Well there was at the end. But idk I was disappointed. 
Enough room for you if that's why you were asking :) 

No the recipe stays the same. But you're onto something. 
Hopefully it occurs to me that there's one thing I can't stand. That's the thought of one single day without your head in my hands 
And dirt likes me 
Lol idk. I'm so p
Haha idk. I'm so pumped for the new bootleg series 
The new bootleg series will be better than arctic monkeys, probably better than mgmt, and maybe better than beck. 
It covers stuff mostly from his worst album. That doesn't mean this is bad. That album had a lot of stupid overdubs and bad song choices. These are stripped down, awesome songs. Check out the mini doc I sent you. And the single. Mmmmmmm
Oh lol 
Hello 
L
Eh 
I don't know... 
Yes 
What's up? 
Awesome. I absolutely love Dawes and had the pleasure of seeing them during their record store tour not too long ago. They played an all acoustic set consisting mostly of new songs. They started with this and later on they did Bear Witness, both of which I think sound much better acoustic than on the record.

My Thoughts on The New Mammal
New Mammal 

Some of us might know about the recent discovery of a mammal, named olinguito, by some scientist. Some might not know about this species, and don't really care either. In any case this post is dedicated to this new species, and as this is my first post, the olinguito has gained a new honour of being mentioned here.

Can I ask you about your personal journey? Like how often do you read your Bible and do you have a system to it? 
I had just been feeling like I need to get into a daily habit of reading and having some personal time set aside specifically for that reason and wanted to know about what other people do. 
Not that I'm modeling myself after you or anything, just that I could get something I've never thought of before that could work for me. 
Ok. 
I mostly just talk. I'll read Wednesday to find something to talk about at youth, which sounds bad, but I usually have been praying about what to teach on since Monday. These past couple weeks I have done relatively little lesson planning, but God has brought up some powerful things in youth. So I'm not worried about finding a lesson or anything so much as just personal growth and I have this love letter, why wouldn't I want to read it?

Thank you so much!

So the pick list divided up between us three tonight and of course I finished my stuff, 
Phillis
So the pick list divided up between us three tonight and of course I finished my stuff, Phyllis finished her list, but Amy did not. The reason why is because she had stationary and when either Phyllis or I were done we could not assist Amy instead we are to bin or go to lunch at 2:30. This is already going to be a problem.
She walked the bleak path to her domain without as much as a frown, for Necromancers felt no pain or physical exhaustion. The Maiden of Iron suddenly started running at a pace faster than a normal human could, a sense of urgency grew within her because when Master Occultist Atultaim calls for the Maiden of Iron it is important. Soon she has covered a great distance without suffering from fatigue entering the Material world again, appearing in the center of a well maintained garden standing near a fountain of blue water. The initiates tending the roses and tulips bowed before her, "Maiden of Iron, you're back...Master Atultaim awaits you in his study." She acknowledged the initiate who spoke, walking the familiar crushed marble path back into the mansion proper. The doors are enchanted to respond those who are recognized as important figures within their society, the Maiden is at the top as ruler of them all.
With long strides the Maiden Of Iron strode down the hall which is adorned with marble, obsidian, and basalt stones etched with runes seething with Nekrisnanji energy. This was a representation of the skill of Atultaim, she had plucked him from the head of a cult which worshipped a being of mystical might...An idea which would of grew into a deity if she had not stopped her present Master Occultist from promoting the belief system. Though sometimes she felt a resentment that came from far off, outside of herself rather than from within meaning that cult still did persist and that deity is out there somewhere waiting for the right time to strike.
Presently this was an issue which wasn?t immediately dire, it would have to wait...As the Maiden passed bowing students without acknowledging their obeisance for it was expected of them to show proper respect. Pushing open the closed obsidian door with ease, she looks past all the old tomes arranged on the shelves shaped from bones and metal over the altar of dimensions to see the older tall man standing behind his desk reaching for a tome which was kept in those shelves since they were constantly used. Two advanced students sat in front of his desk, they seemed ready to face their Death and hopefully return from the Realm of the Dead.
The Maiden patiently waited for Atultaim to finish his task before speaking to him.

Should I try coaxing Lola out for a walk with some cheese? 
I'm going to try it, I don't want to just give up :/
I didn't put her leash on or anything and just tried to get her close to the door with the cheese. She would take the cheese but then run behind your dad's chair to eat it! Silky dog! Oh yay! I'm excited! 
Yeah! She didn't even think twice when they went out the door together! Can you believe that?! 
How are you feeling Lex?! We've missed you at work! 
Sorry I didn't answer fianc, I'm at the gym
Definitely! 
I'm excited! 
Dad, before you go for a run do you tighten the band up some? 
Got your voicemail! Thanks for that :) I was wondering about Logan's suit though, how am I going to get reimburse for that? Maddie and I need to have as much credit available as possible, were going to need to juggle about $6k for the reception 
No, when did you send it?

Graduation
Dear Psychology Team, 
I called and had an advising appointment at the beginning of the summer with Sarah Davis, we talked about the classes I needed to graduate and determined that my degree was almost complete. There was one class that shows as "in progress" but I was told that it was not going to affect my graduation and would fall off. I completed my last class on the 13th of August but my degree still says "applied", can I get some clarity and peace on mind in this process? 
Thank you,

After I had done DMT, I looked at things differently. I don't know how to explain it effectively but if I had to, id have to say it cleared my thought process out. Like, I used to have a very scattered thought process, but its straight forward now. 

Also, over the course of a year, I've dropped a lot of acid. Atleast 30 times. I can't look at a blank wall without seeing stuff. Its painful.

Alrighty 
Thanks babe. 
Its 125 to fix the tv 
Hey dad we found a 42 inch plasma tv. It has no base so it would probably have to be mounted. Its 125 to fix the green color of the screen. Other than that it's a nice tv. Not sure if it's worth it and we probably can't put it up anywhere until we move what do you think? 
Yeah we got a free estimate from a tv repair place
Checked 4 other places and they charged 40-50 for an estimate 
Yeah found next to dumpster. 
Okay. Its pretty heavy for being so flat. I think it will be nice mounted though
He offered to store it in the attic. So maybe. 
Don't think it would fit in our room anywhere do you?

Where do you live? Just so I know what you're basing your opinion on. Farmers have morals too. So do the Colombian people. And every Colombian I have spoken to hates the drug trade. Along with my great uncle, who is a coffee farmer in Colombia. And he said that he hates the guerilla, and he also hates the drug trade, and would not grow drugs. I was reading about a town in the southern part of Colombia filled with small farmers who were being forced to grow marijuana and cocaine

As soon as the government came in and pushed the guerilla out, the farmers were happy and started to grow regular crops. I'm not disagreeing with you, a few will grow drugs, but most of them will do something else.

In all seriousness, it's called you grow your own damn food, that's why they're farmers. Think about it. It's something you seem to be unable to do.

So while you're living your sheltered life somewhere in America and reading the news, thinking you know everything and thinking you're so cultured, you're just an idiot with the Internet. The moon has no sociopolitical events that shape it, it's a rock floating in space. Colombia or Pakistan or what have you actually have people, with feelings and stuff, and you can't get that from reading the news. So, yeah. That's that. I feel pretty satisfied. 
No, not quite. It involves listing the files and storing them in a variable, which you then use to copy to the SD card. Hold on, I'll find the link. I didn't invent this, someone better than me with Tasker did. 

Edit: This is it. I edited it to make it easier to understand. I have it set as the exit task whenever I open the Camera app.

> 1)
Under the "Profiles" tab in Tasker create a profile and call it whatever you like.

2)
Assign a context to this profile.
For me I assigned the Camera app open for the profile to be triggered.

3)
Create a new task. (Make it an exit task)
I called mine "MovePictures" since I want to move the pictures around that I took while the Camera app was open. 

4)
Now edit this newly created task.
In edit move hit the "+" sign
In the "Select Action Category" menu select the following: File> List Files
> In the "List Files" menu under "Dir" hit the Magnify glass and select a directory by long pressing on it
> In the "Variable" section type in some variable - Mine looked like this %FilesToMove
Then hit the Green Check Mark

5)
Hit the "+" sign again
In the "Select Action Category" menu select the following: Task > For
In the "For" menu under "Variable" create a new variable name - Mine looked like this %FilesToMoved
> In the Items box type the name of the variable you created in step 4 followed by an open and closed curved bracket - Mine looked like this: %FilesToMove()
Then hit the Green Check Mark

6)
Hit the "+" sign again
In the "Select Action Category" menu select the following: File > Move
In the "Move"" menu under "From" use the new variable name created in step 5 - Mine looked like this: %FilesToMoved
> In the "To" box hit the magnify glass and select your destination directory by long pressing. 
Then hit the Green Check Mark

7)
Hit the "+" sign again 
In the "Select Action Category" menu select the following: Task > End for
Then hit the Green Check Mark 

Then you are pretty much done.

Then you can test your task to see if it does what you want.

This is what I did anyway and it appears to be working.
I am still pretty new to tasker so I definitely might have messed something up.
Give it a try though and just see if you can get it working.

Every single number and combination of numbers is contained in pi. Take the first billion decimals of pi. At some point the first billion decimals are repeated. I don't know where it starts, perhaps the first billion are repeated at the trillionth decimal. Assume that is true and the one billion and oneth place is 7. Then the first billion numbers occur again in the same order from one trillion to the one trillion and one billionth places. But the one trillion one billion and oneth place is 3 this time. So it's not rational. Also the proof posted here is really good. Euler (think eulers method, f(x), popularized pi, e as in e^x ) was the first one to prove sqrt(2) is irrational. 
Some benchmarking tools use formulas to calculate digits of pi as a way to measure how many calculations per second your computer can handle. That's a fairly good use for all the digits of pi but it's not really using the digits, just the formula. 
We could never calculate all the digits of pi, not even at the rate of one quadrillion digits per second or more. Why? Because pi has an infinite amount of decimals. As far as we know now, there are no real applications for calculating more than about 20 digits. Think about it. If you are calculating something with the precision of 20 digits the last few are so small they're practically zero. 0.00000000000000000001 is pretty much zero. Could you think of a task where being off by that much would have any significance?

I may be biased, but the 80s and 90s had the best music. 
90s music

Gotta have 80s new wave, pop, and hair metal!
There's great music today. It just isn't found on mainstream radio. 
I know I'm biased. Nostalgia! 
Don't get me wrong, I like some 70s rock and beach music. Every decade has something to offer. 80s and 90s are still my tops. 
I prefer the Foo Fighters to Nirvana. 
Favorite 90s song? 
BTE had to be in top 5 or 3
As a Christian man, I have faced many life changing events, both good and bad. One of the greatest moments that defined my life occurred three years ago today as Candace and I were seen as two people in great need by God our Father. Outside of Christ, there has been nothing more compelling, life-changing, and amazing as our son, Emerson. Today, we not only celebrate his third birthday, but also the third anniversary of the catalyst that has molded our family for Christ, alone. We love you son. You might not be God's gift to the world, but you are, without a single doubt, God's gift to us. Happy Birthday, Emerson! We love you more than words.

Where i lived in elko nevada gold mines were a big part of the town so I worked out at one for a company called barrick for the summer, I really enjoyed it. As for the tv's I guess we can get it figured out tomorrow, I meant to email you back sooner but I sort of spaced it. We can sort that crap out tomorrow though.

Nice, sounds like a solid summer as well. I mostly did odd jobs for work, I built a deck and did yard work for people and spent a few weekends working at some art shows hauling stuff. what about your work? My xbox is the same old white one with like a 30GB hard drive. I'll bring mine up regardless but if yours is nicer or if you just want yours bring it too. I've also got a couple controller which i'll bring and I don't know what games you have but i've got halo 3 and reach, skyrim, fable 3, soul calibur 4, and assassin's creed brotherhood and a super old madden game like 2006. Tomorrow morning I'm seeing if i have room in the car for my tv which is a 42" and i'll let you know on that. I don't know what else your bringing to the room but other then the xbox and possibly a tv i just have clothes and bedding and that sort of shit.

Sounds like you had a pretty kick ass summer, where did you work?
A little about me: During high school i was on the golf team, i was in FBLA, and i also was into photography and junk like that for the school. I mostly just worked over the summer, went camping a couple of times with some friends and also a couple of road trips but it for the most part it was a pretty mellow summer.
I was planning on bringing my TV which is a 32" that should fit pretty well in the dorm, and also my xbox with a couple of controllers and games. what xbox do you think we should bring? mine is just one of the old white ones with the detachable hard drive

What's up? My name is Austin Anderson and I'm obviously your roommate. I'll give you an idea of what I'm like and ask questions if you want. I've live in Boise, Idaho. In high school I was on the Ultimate frisbee team and in theater and DECA. This summer I spent most of my time in Colorado (Denver) and Washington (Seattle) and I've done some fishing and some camping this summer as well as seen a concert or two when i wasn't working. Generally, I'm fairly laid back and pretty easy to live with but let me know if you have any concerns. Anyway, I don't think i can bring a tv (but that might change). I do have my xbox 360 and some games to bring. What were you thinking of bringing?

Hey man, my name is Andrew Dobak and it looks like we're going to be roommates this fall. I was just emailing you to see whats up so we're not complete strangers when we move in. I was also looking to see if you were going to bring an xbox or a tv, maybe we can plan who brings what when it comes to those things.

It's a great pleasure being able to reach out to the fellow members of AMSA Japan. Welcome to the big family. 
I joined my first AMSA conference in 2009. That was AMSC Taiwan and I was still in first year. It was a memorable one. I made a lot of new friends, get to learn a lot of new stuff. And my journey didn't just stop there. I went on to join a total of 7 conferences, and each felt just as new. 
This, my friends, is the beauty of AMSA. It is with AMSA you get to learn knowledge that are not written in your textbooks. Here's an example: how do the locals deal with alcohol addiction? In Thailand, they stop selling alcohol after 11pm. In France, parents expose their children early on so they don't become curious as they grow up. The Koreans? Well they don't care. 
At AMSA we always welcome you with our arms wide open. There's no use for me to keep talking, because I believe you'll only grow to love the magic of AMSA once you've join us.

What is your biggest fear?
That ask.fm will one day forget to make a really embarrassing anonymous!
Hottest sophomore, junior, and senior at Meadows? 
Can I just say I think we would get along fabulously?
Who's the hottest gay guy at your school?
I'm reading some of your questions and answers... Omg these are great xD
Do you think the B and T parts of LGBT sometimes get left behind? 
No. 
Jennifer hernandez
First thing's first: I don't really know any gay guys. I know OF gay guys, but I'm not close friends with any. Which is weird because I'm practically gay myself... But I digress. I'd have to say Bennett, he seems like a pretty chill guy and he's not unattractive. However a) I don't know him and b) he's in a relationship so that's out of the question anyway. 
Forgotten about. It seems like in the mad rush for "gay rights," trans rights are almost forgotten about, and biphobia and transphobia still run rampant, even among the gay community. 
At this point... None really. The few girls I've liked in the past didn't feel the same, and I'm fine with that now. And I don't really feel romantically about any girls right now. 
Honestly? Yes. I'm still trying to sort out who the fuck I am, it's so confusing... And I already came out as bi so to go back and say "lol jk I'm actually gay!" would just be... I don't know. Can I take a minute and just say how much I hate these arbitrary labels society makes us use? Ugh. I'm done. 
That depends on the person. There are some people I can talk about ANYTHING with. Others, I'm decidedly more reserved. If I trust you, I'll talk totally openly with you, simple as that.

I was at the golden address until I left for the military on the 4th of May 2009. And I figured those darn overdrafts might bite me. While totally unintentional. 
O yeah I was at that job just before I left for Arkansas after getting back from the Usmc. So from the end of my active service date's (April 9th) to I think the middle of May 2011. So not long at all.
And from May to July 31st I was doing odd jobs in Arkansas while living with Anna's Grandmother because I couldn't start work at the VA until paperwork went through. So there ended up being a two month gap in my employment. 
Hey Deza I gave all necessary paperwork to our friend Matt at Envoy Mortgage. 
Hey Deza I gave all necessary paperwork to our friend Matt at Envoy Mortgage. He is working on the pre-approval and has given me a rough ballpark number for the price of a nice property so.. On that note, I think we can go ahead she start looking for something. As I said before we are looking at all the options, however, we do want to look at getting away from people haha! So up north near Wellington Colorado is where I would like to start looking. 180 is really a Max number and 150 would be ideal that way I have room to move for fixing/adding onto the property.

Thank you

Man sorry to announce but Yahoo is not bronson back Salary Cap this year.. So I won't be able to do the buy in league like I planned... I may do a regular fantasy but I have made a decision.

Man it seems like what Kendrick said went over most people's (including all the response rapper's) heads... 
Lawd. The struggle with listening and comprehension skills in general is real. 
Kendrick basically said he was on their level, meaning those he considered great... Told the other noobs to step their game up and dropped the mic on some sexual chocolate shit... 
To be real he has no reason to go at them... Different generations. Besides there's nothing he can do to erase what they've accomplished. Like their is nothing LeBron can do to erase what MJ was to basketball in the 90's even if he surpassed him and breaks all his records. You have to respect each in their era. 
Hahahaha. I hear you. It's art, though. All this shit is subjective anyways. 
I don't there will ever be a diss record harder than Hit'em Up. Not Ether, not SuperUgly, not even No Vaseline (for you true/old heads out there)

Based on most of these reactions (or responses) to KDot's verse, it's obvious that listening and comprehension skills struggle is real... 
@AlexGH22 @WestGaFresh @UnthawableSoul do any of you remember who had the Seahawks in SH? Thought it was you @WestGaFresh, I can't remember
@WestGaFresh @AlexGH22 @UnthawableSoul LOL Ok. I figured if you had them, you weren't going to give them up.

Keyboard

Portal 

You probably want to type on your mobile device really fast but then you have to sacrifice typing error free. If you chose to type precise so you can type error free, you then have to sacrifice speed. There is just no way around it.... Until now! Introducing Fleksy, a mobile keyboard by a start-up named Syntellia, that aims to make you type so accurately while missing every single letter. 

This keyboard was ironically designed for blind people meaning that you can miss every single letter cause you don't have to look at the screen while tying making this very fast to use while still getting it accurate 98% of the time. For example in this entire paragraph I missed almost every single word and it corrected it correctly except for 3 or 4 words. Most of the time I was only hitting the home row of the keyboard instead of the actual letters! 

Since you don't have to be exact, you can shrink the keyboard to really small sizes. Not just are there 3 size options in the settings, you can combine this with the fact that the keyboard uses gestures to space, delete, and switch predictions, to completely get rid of the space bar row or make the keyboard invisible. Yes you heard me right, you can make the keyboard completely invisible! 

So how do you operate the keyboard without the space bar or in invisible mode. Well other than the standard flick right to space, flick left to delete, and flick up or down to switch suggestions , to capitalize you flick up on the bottom left. Similarly, you flick up on the bottom right to enter. Hold on these gestures will CAPS LOCK and Voice Search. Finally, flick from bottom left or right toward the center to get two different pages of symbols. But the most important gesture is probably the one to switch to the mini or invisible layouts, just flick down or up with two fingers. 

Now that we know the basics of this keyboard, let's go through the settings! First, there is an interactive tutorial that shows you how to use all the gestures. Second, there is a game that allows you to try to beat the Guiness World Record for a change to win a Nexus 7.

Mrs. Noem,
As a concerned South Dakotan, I'm writing to you, my representative, with a national concern.
I, and a growing number of my fellow citizens, are emphatically opposed to the actions of the NSA, starting under former President George W. Bush and continuing under President Obama. We feel that such actions as mass farming of phone records, and web history (including data given by Google, Microsoft, and Apple) violates the Fourth Amendment and our privacy. Simply out, Democracy can not work when citizens are being constantly monitored. 
I write to you because it was widely reported that during a recent session, you and Sen. Thune voted to continue funding the NSA's efforts. When I wrote to Sen. Thune, I received a response stating that his primary reason was protected citizens from terrorism. I hope this is not a mindset you share. The threat of terrorist attacks is greatly exaggerated, often by those who seek to profit from the results. Put simply, in South Dakota, I'm more worried about a grain silo exploding than Al Qaeda.

Because of Hitler, Britain was facing hardships in the ww2. They weren't even getting half the things they shouldve got under the Marshall plan. 

After 1947, Britain (and France too) withdrew their rule from various colonies like palestine, Egypt, sri lanka, etc. 

Had hit not been for Hitler, their role would have continued for another 30ish years, by which time gandhiji would have died naturally.

See here's what happened. 

I, Samarth, atishay, Srishita, and devang (I guess that's his name, in the f building he stays. ) were talking about ghosts. 

We were really freaked out, discussing bhool bhulaiya, then devang just said the word aathma (the movie). Every one (excluding me and devang) ran out of fear.

?QUIT! GIVE UP! YOU?RE BEATEN!? They shout and plead,
There?s just too much against you now, this time you can?t succeed.
And as I start to hang my head in front of failure?s face,
My downward fall is broken by the memory of a race.
And hope refills my weakened will as I recall that scene.
For just the thought of that short race rejuvenates my being.
A children?s race, young boys, young men; now I remember well.
Excitement, sure, but also fear; it wasn?t hard to tell.
They all lined up so full of hope. Each thought to win that race.
Or tie for first, or if not that, at least take second place.
And fathers watched from off the side, each cheering for his son.
And each boy hoped to show his dad that he would be the one.
The whistle blew and off they went, young hearts and hopes of fire.
To win, to be the hero there, was each young boy?s desire.
And one boy in particular, his dad was in the crowd,
Was running near the lead and thought, ?My dad will be so proud.?
But as he speeded down the field across a shallow dip,
The little boy who thought to win, lost his step and slipped.
Trying hard to catch himself, his hands flew out to brace,
And mid the laughter of the crowd, he fell flat on his face.
So down he fell and with him hope. He couldn?t win it now.
Embarrassed, sad, he only wished to disappear somehow.
But as he fell, his dad stood up and showed his anxious face,
Which to the boy so clearly said, ?Get up and win that race!?
He quickly rose, no damage done ? behind a bit, that?s all,
And ran with all his mind and might to make up for his fall.
So anxious to restore himself to catch up and to win,
His mind went faster than his legs. He slipped and fell again.
He wished that he had quite before with only one disgrace.
I?m hopeless as a runner now, I shouldn?t try to race.
But, in the laughing crowd he searched and found his father?s face
That steady look that said again, ?Get up and win the race.?
So, he jumped up to try again. Ten yards behind the last.
If I?m to gain those yards, he thought, I?ve got to run real fast.
Exceeding everything he had, he regained eight or ten,
But trying so hard to catch the lead, he slipped and fell again.
Defeat! He lay there silently, a tear dropped from his eye.
There?s no sense running anymore ? three strikes and I?m out ? why try?
The will to rise had disappeared, all hope had flew away.
So far behind, so error prone, closer all the way.
I?ve lost, so what?s the use, he thought, I?ll live with my disgrace.
But then he thought about his dad, who soon he?d have to face.
?Get up,? an echo sounded low. ?Get up and take your place.
You were not meant for failure here, get up and win the race.?
With borrowed will, ?Get up,? it said, ?You haven?t lost at all,
For winning is not more than this, to rise each time you fall.?
So up he rose to win once more. And with a new commit,
He resolved that win or lose, at least he wouldn?t quit.
So far behind the others now, the most he?d ever been.
Still he gave it all he had and ran as though to win.
Three times he?d fallen stumbling, three times he?d rose again.
Too far behind to hope to win, he still ran to the end.
They cheered the winning runner as he crossed first place.
Head high and proud and happy; no falling, no disgrace.
But when the fallen youngster crossed the line, last place,
The crowd gave him the greater cheer for finishing the race.
And even though he came in last, with head bowed low, unproud;
You would have thought he?d won the race, to listen to the crowd.
And to his Dad he sadly said, ?I didn?t do so well.?
?To me you won,? his father said, ?You rose each time you fell.?
And when things seemed dark and hard and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy ? helps me in my race.
For all of life is like that race, with ups and down and all,
And all you have to do to win ? is rise each time you fall.
?Quit!? ?GIVE UP, YOU?RE BEATEN.? They still shout in my face.
But another voice within me says, ?GET UP AND WIN THE RACE!?
?QUIT! GIVE UP! YOU?RE BEATEN!? They shout and plead,
There?s just too much against you now, this time you can?t succeed.

And as I start to hang my head 
in front of failure?s face,
My downward fall is broken by 
the memory of a race.

And hope refills my weakened will as I recall that scene.
For just the thought of that short race rejuvenates my being.

he regained eight or ten,
But trying so hard to catch the lead, 
he slipped and fell again.

Defeat! He lay there silently, 
a tear dropped from his eye.
There?s no sense running anymore ? three strikes and I?m out ? why try?

The will to rise had disappeared, all hope had flew away.
So far behind, so error prone, 
a loser all the way.

I?ve lost, so what?s the use, he thought, 
I?ll live with my disgrace.
But then he thought about his dad, who soon he?d have to face.

And even though he came in last, with head bowed low, unproud;
You would have thought he?d won the race, 
to listen to the crowd.

And to his Dad he sadly said, 
?I didn?t do too well.?
?To me you won,? his father said, ?You rose each time you fell.?

And when things seemed dark and hard 
and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy ? helps me in my race.

For all of life is like that race,

The crowd gave him the greater cheer for finishing the race.

And even though he came in last, with head bowed low, unproud;
You would have thought he?d won the race, 
to listen to the crowd.

And to his Dad he sadly said, 
?I didn?t do too well.?
?To me you won,? his father said, ?You rose each time you fell.?

And when things seemed dark and hard 
and difficult to face,
The memory of that little boy ? helps me in my race.

For all of life is like that race, 
with ups and down and all,
And all you have to do to win 
is rise each time you fall.

?Quit!? ?GIVE UP, YOU?RE BEATEN.? They still shout in my face.
But another voice within me says, ?GET UP AND WIN THE RACE!?

Swiftkey has auto correction like Fleksy too. But typing your own word (not in the dictionary ) can be a bit troublesome. Which is easier in Fleksy, you simply swipe up, and it reverts back to what you originally typed. 

But yeah, swiftkey is cool. 

Try getting the apk of minuum if you don't wanna pay for it ;P 

But Fleksy is much much better than minuum. I've tried both. 

And touchpal is also kind of okay.

The most beautiful alarm clock ever. 

It utilizes the minimalist design so well, and with such simple, yet outstanding animations, this app is perfect. 

It comes with challenge to stop alarm, light sleep alarm, lower volume when you pick up the phone to turn off the alarm, beautiful looking stopwatch and countdown timer, and a minimalist widget in built. 

For free! 

This is a must try app. 


The view from my balcony. 

Taken using HDR mode. 

Man, this looks prettier than it does with the eye! 

No post processing involved. It is what came by the HDR mode of the camera! 
Some of the TW features are amazing! 

The stock camera is awesome. 

Adapt sound really works well. 

I'd miss s beam and wifi direct file transfers too. ( is there the option to share files with wifi direct on the ge edition? )
30mbps file transfer is amazing! 
Movies get transferred in minutes! 

Slow motion 100fps video recording! Super cool! 

Other than that, battery life would be a major major plus point on the ge. ?

Works great on the Asus transformer prime. It runs very smooth and the features are awesome. I love having the ability could set your own wallpaper though, instead of just having the default ones.  Edit: I also tested it out on my Nexus 4 and liked it as well. The more I use it the more I like it. There is room for improvement though. Just one example is that when you switch from landscape to portrait mode (or vise versa) the widgets don't flip the way one would expect. Keep up the good work though.

Any advice I give is to help you, not hurt you. My prayers for you are genuine. I also hope you are using your Bible for guidance. If you start to feel discouraged just ask me for encouragement I will be happy to do it. Have a great night.

It's so cute, they are running real plays now. Your son is an offensive machine. 
You will come back and be stronger. Don't lose your faith. God will be there for you. Randomly choose verses to read. It will help. Jeremiah is playing football now. He's pretty good. Jeremiah misses his sister too. I will forward my verses of the day that I think may encourage you. Love you.

I am so thankful to have Scherry in my life. She loves and supports me more than I deserve. 
You are not alone.. This past week has been a horrible one. I thought I could help by making Theresa act right
Then I find out she can only help herself and is just using me. I hurt you do bad and I don't mean too 
I am only nice because you've taught me about caring more for others than myself. I don't even argue with people anymore. 
At GFF Jeremiah said he wished you had taken him because I was mean because I told him not to hit my back
You are the nicest, sweetest person I've ever known 
I am not. I try in my heart to treat you the best way, but I continue to make the worst decisions and hurt you. I am so sorry
I love you so much. I want you to feel the way you make me feel inside. You make me feel loved, wanted and needed
My only fear is to let you down
cherrywithns@gmail.com
I've never done things for you because I was afraid. I have always thought of you as my partner and have tried to make you proud of me
I used to be totally self centered and cared only about what I wanted but your love and kindness has shown me a better way and my life is better for it
You deserve better than me. You are a queen, an angel, a great and loving person who doesn't deserve any pain. 
I try so hard to help Jeremiah be a good and loving person so he won't make the mistakes I've made

Oh... Not good. You couldn't just open up the case and fix it? 
Stupid warranty rules. Yeah I would have too... 
Well I'm just a bit biased in that... But I'd say android. Though I'm presuming you'd jailbreak on iPhone? 
As far as music goes on android Google play music has come a long way. And its super easy to switch from itunes. As far as cases and stuff it really depends on the phone. Mine is kinda hard to find stuff for but some like the samsung galaxys have almost as much as iphones. I will say this for iphones though. Group messaging and customer service. 
ff52d924175ef8faf90649927af87ca.flv
Some people have had success with it using apps to replace the stock messaging and on a few phones it works most of the time natively but on mine its pretty much a disaster. You might ask Demian how his works. Think of Google play like itunes. There's Google play music Google play store Google play books etc. Yeah or from the phone. I can stream my music or add remove apps from my phone on any computer with Internet. Just sign on to Google and its all there. 
Haha yeah there's a small problem. Once again I'm biased but I would say wait until the nexus 5 (the next version of mine) or whatever it's called is released and then decide. Historically that'll be this fall or early winter. The nexus line is nice because we get updates straight from Google instead of waiting months for oems to modify them. And prices for an unlocked no contract phone are much better. Also it depends on whether you like the skins that the manufacturers put on the phones. Though you could also put a custom rom on that'll do the same thing 
Oh and if you do decide to do a lot a customizing with it in the way of roms you can't mess a nexus up too bad unlike other phones. 
Haha sorry. Oems are original equipment manufacturers like samsung htc Motorola etc. Kinda. But not like I wanna run android 4.0 instead of 4.3. Its more like they add additional options that stock android or the skins don't have. 
Well you can't really do it next year either because the training is during the school year. But I looked at cal polys team and it seemed pretty easy to join. 
Katelynn found it at a job fair at the end of sophmore year and asked if I wanted to do it with her 
A ton of trainings and two searches. When I say a ton I think my training hours are close to 200 since last September 
Haha basically the idea is that you can survive out on your own with only the stuff in your pack for 24 hours. I don't think that's ever happened to a team though 
Just do it in college! 
You could get lost... Be sorta like doing it but the other way around

Ah okay. S3 maybe? I'm not a big fan of the ui but that's a matter of personal preference and you could change it. Or htc one 
It depends on how much you want to change. You can just change the homescreen with an app or you can unlock the bootloader and install a custom rom at which point you can customize almost anything

For you I would say no since you have enough experience to change it without too much difficulty and there's good websites for that kind of stuff. xda developers is a good one

Yeah but your sisters may have the wrong type of life insurance. Let me call them, if it ain't broke I won't fix it. But what if their policy don't work the way they think it does or if I can give them more coverage for the same price or the same coverage for cheaper.

If u ever need someone to talk to to cheer u up, I'm always here any time! 
It'll take some time but once u emotionally detach yourself from them and they know they ain't got you by the balls (so to speak), that basically they can't affect you anymore. All of a sudden shit magically changes. Either way it's a win win for u! And we've been split about 10 months.

Technically by the time this movie hits theaters it'll have been three four years. I assumed since Nolan produced man of steel that 

It'll be like three four years after Rises that this is gonna come out so technically it's not that short of a time gap. My only thing was I thought that since Nolan produced it, they could bring Bale back and make it fit into the original trilogy as an intermediary plot (like Lion King 1 1/2 lol) but I guess not.

Knowing is half the battle. 

But something I've learned about android is there is no identical device. Each have a mind of its own. 

Is there something else I can do to give you more details?

This is very nice indeed! I really like the Fleksy keyboard but unfortunately it doesn't support the German language. 
max

@fleksy This keyboard experience is amazing! Adding German is on 6th spot in your requests. How fast do you think this could be added?

@trade605 indeed. I really have no idea why it does that. Super annoying. 
@Teslief @insanj exactly. Worked fine on 6.0 but after upgrading to 6.1.2 they won't save.. Haven't found a way to fix this. 
So it's around 2pm. Hope that damn tweet about my battery won't pop up again. :/
@DEATHmeNEVER :D
Okay from now on I'll call you an ambulance 
@insanj always the same. Got that too often. -.-
Cut the rope 

"@ID_AA_Carmack: Heard in jest, but not a bad idea -- "garbage collection should be done when the user blinks"" mind = blown!
@bensge 's popoveractions is actually pretty cool :)
I'll have a look and tell you. Don't know at the moment. Last month was all about finals :D
It's in TPBottomBar's relock method and in dimscreen of SBAwayController (the latter for AndroidLock compatibility )
So this round of Counter Strike just started and BOOM Windows software update -.- 
That looks tremendous! Can't wait to see this on my springboard! Since I finished finals last Friday I started continued work on it today. Gonna do a more and more in the next couple of days. ;)

Ah. Well in on my nexus 7 so that isn't really practical. 
I'd moan back as you gave me the chills. I'd then slowly slide your panties off as I kissed my way back down to your waist. I'd pull one of your legs over my shoulder as kissed your pussy. Slowly I'd lick with my tongue as my hands grabbed your butt and boobs.

Hey, 

Sorry to do this again but a two days notice is not enough time. I'm moving to manhole Saturday. We have a uhaul scheduled and I cannot change that. On top of that, Jesse is my moving buddy so we are both busy Saturday.

That is true. I don't believe we are needed at all. Part of what I was gonna discuss with them. 

Just pissed me off that they try to include or ask us for something like that with a two day notice. Not is it ok?? But we are doing this... Just pissed me off.

Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th. 
Yo, our current line of thinking is to go to the fair on the 16th, then have a cookout at our house on the 17th. This would give Masato a day to relax at home before flying to Tampa on the 18th in the morning. Additionally, Friday the 16th is "foodie friday" and all the food vendors have an item for 50% off that day. Can you come on the 16th? Alternatively, you can wander up for the cookout on the 17th? 
I will check the weather on Monday and decide with Masato. Of the 16th and 17th, one day will be a hangout day at our house and a cookout, and one will be a state fair day. Do you prefer one or the other?

Mehregan Apple Pie

8 large apples peeled, cored, and sliced
1 tbsp  lemon juice
2 tbsp  white sugar
1/3 cup  maple syrup
1/4 cup  brown sugar
1 1/2 tsp  cinnamon
1/2 tsp  ground ginger
1 1/2 tbsp  cornstarch
1/4 tsp  salt
milk

Persian ingredients:
dash of saffron
1 1/2 tsp cardamom
crushed pistachios


=== CRUST ===

1. Roll one batch of the pie pastry into a 13-inch circle and line a 9 1/2 inch
pie pan with it, letting the excess dough drape over the edge. Refrigerate the
pie shell while making the filling.


=== FILLING ===

1. Combine the apples, 3 tbsp of white sugar, and lemon juice. Mix well, then
set aside for 10 minutes to juice.

2. After 10 minutes, mix the remaining maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon,
ground ginger, cornstarch, and salt with the apples. Mix well.

To make it Persian, add a dash of saffron in step 1, and cardamom in an equal
amount to cinnamon in step 2.


=== BAKING ===

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Roll the remaining chilled pastry into an 11 inch
circle. Scrape the filling into the bottom pie shell and smooth with a spoon.

2. Lightly moisten the rim of the pie shell. Place the rolled dough over the top
of the filling and press the top and bottom shells together at the edge.

3. Trim the dough flush with the edge of the pan. Press on the rim with the
tines of a fork to make a crimped edge. With the fork, poke the top of the pie
crust several times to make steam vents. Brush the top of the pie lightly with
milk (for glaze) and sprinkle with sugar.

To make it Persian, sprinkle crushed pistachios on top.

4. Bake on the center oven rack for 30 minutes at 400F. Reduce the heat to 375F
and rotate the pie 180 degrees. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes more, until any
visible juices bubble thickly. Transfer the pie to a rack and cool at least
2 hours before serving.

1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste
1/2 cup sour cream, for topping

3. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until

pot. Add the raw garlic to the soup, cover and turn off the heat. Let stand for
5 minutes. Taste, and season with salt, pepper and sugar.

4. Ladle into serving bowls, and garnish with sour cream and fresh parsley.


COMMENT BY USER eatmedetroit:
I have used this recipe twice-excellent. Read carefully, I have been to
23 countries. This is how I modified: No meat--too greasy. No garlic--not needed.
No sugar--use aged vinegar, nice and sweet. I also added one cube chicken
boullion and one can of chicken stock, no fat. Also HALF the tomato paste.
FRESH dill--lots. Cooked onions in grape seed oil, high burn rate. If you follow
what I suggest, you will achive culinary greatness and Ukrainian authenticity.

1 container of fresh oysters
3/4 pint of heavy whipping cream

olive oil over medium heat.

2. After the vegetables are cooked, add sake/white wine, soy sauce, tomato,

3. Add plenty of water to cover the vegetables. Add the juices from the canned
clams, oysters, and crabs. Simmer for about an hour.

4. Stir in flour, to slightly thicken the soup. Add the clams, crab meat, and
fresh oysters. Stir in the heavy whipping cream, and bring back to a simmer for
about 20 minutes. SIMMER, DO NOT BOIL -- the cream will curdle. Serve when ready.

Cranberry Shortbread Cookies
* modified from joyofbaking.com/shortbreads/RaisinShortbreads.html

1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups cranberries
1/2 cup nuts (any kind)
bit of cinnamon
bit of cardamom
1 large egg, lightly beaten


1. Preheat oven to 350F. Butter/oil a cookie sheet.

2. Beat the butter and vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Add the sugar
and beat until light and fluffy.

3. In a separate bowl whisk the flour with the salt. Add the flour mixture to
the butter mixture and beat until the dough just comes together. If the dough is
too dry, add a small amount of soft butter and milk.

4. Split the dough roughly in half. Spread half of the dough over the bottom of
the prepared sheet, and gently press the dough to form an even layer. Sprinkle
the cranberries and nuts over the dough, and gently press them into the dough.
Sprinkle cinnamon and cardamom evenly over the layer, to taste.

5. Mix the remaining half of the dough until it is crumbly, and sprinkle the
crumbles even over the layer. Gently press the crumbles down for stability.

6. Take the lightly beaten egg and, using a pastry brush, coat the top of the
shortbread with the egg wash. Then, with the tines of a fork, slowly drag the
fork back and forth across the shortbread to make a decorative pattern.

7. Bake the shortbread at 350F for about 30 - 40 minutes or until light golden
brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.

I don't follow. Alternative medicine is already a huge market, probably because it already is not prescription. Anyone is free to buy alternative medicine from whoever produces it. 

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition.

If real medicine weren't prescription-only, people would be free to buy it easily, and there'd be price competition. You'd go to the doctor to get diagnosed, and the doctor would tell you what drugs to get. It's no different than going to a mechanic to get your car problems diagnosed. But you don't need a prescription to get parts for your car. And most people have a mechanic they trust, just like they have a doctor they trust. 
You're already getting commercials for snake-oil erectile dysfunction "medicine" (which is not FDA-approved and often not even safe). So what harm would it be to have commercials for real erection dysfunction drugs that actually work and aren't tainted with lead?

One of my brothers friends is a conservation officer. Some of those pot growths are booby-trapped to hell. If I was OP, I'd report that to someone and stay away from that area. 
Depends on location. We have one acre in our backyard with some tiny woods. If you live in the countryside with lots of acres, you might have more woods.

How many impoverished immigrant parents are horribly educated, can barely speak English, but invest a huge amount of time and effort making sure their kids grow up with better opportunities than they did? A lot. 

The first thing someone notices about you is your appearance--how you dress, your mannerisms, how you carry yourself. The second thing they notice is what comes out as soon as you open your mouth.

If you screw either one of those things up from the beginning, people aren't going to take you seriously; they're going to make a conclusion about who you are by those first moments. 

First impressions are important. How you speak is part of it. 
I've never seen an outhouse in Tennessee, but I have seen bathrooms of such poor quality and sanitation at rural gas stations that I'd have rather used an outhouse or a port-o-potty. 

By the way, I believe the majority of Alaskans actually do use outhouses.

Ah. There'd very little the kid can do. I thought you were suggesting that it's not unreasonable that impoverished, uneducated parents can't raise a child out of the poverty cycle because they, themselves, were raised poorly. 

If you're a kid born to crap parents, there's not much you can do other than just to do your best. But if you have kids of your own, there's no reason that they have to be raised in the same way.

I think police would find that of they acted with reasonable force 
If more cops acted this way, people would trust them more. If people trusted them more, they'd also cooperate more. If people trusted and cooperated with police, the police would have much less reason to feel threatened by the public, and they'd probably find that their job even becomes safer.

Arab countries have done this numerous times before in Israel's short history, and Israel has come out on top every time. Israel has an extremely competent and strong military, and it is precisely because of this strength that the United States even started to ally with them as a Middle-Eastern counter to the Soviet Union. Israel is, today, militarily stronger than ever before in history. The Arab nations will not go to war for Palestine, *again*, because they will not win that war, *again*. And if they use terrorism as a way to perpetually harass the Israeli population, they'll find themselves on the receiving end of Israeli air strikes. 
Nuclear weapons are almost strategically worthless. Israel will not use nuclear weapons. Neither will Iran, for that matter.

Palestine is as much of a mess, with basically several governments and a complete refusal to accept Israel's existence. Not only does Israel exist, it exists so much that it's occupied you for decades and can basically unilaterally decide your fate! It also refuses to renounce violence, even though Palestinian terror is the primary excuse Israel uses to justify its actions, and even though a pacifist Palestine would undeniably be on the moral high ground, almost assuring better international support.

On top of all of this, both sides seem to most agree on a two state solution, but that's a mess, too. How can you live in such a small area with so many locked-down borders? How can business get done? And Palestine is so incredibly small, how can it succeed as a country? The Gaza Strip is smaller than most sponsors in America, and the West Bank is smaller than even a moderately-sized American metro area.

A real liquor store is going to have a phenomenal liquor selection compared to Wal-Mart, as well. If you're in West Lafayette, you can probably just Google "best beer selection purdue," or something of that nature. You should be able to buy beer no problem. I have Chinese friends who use their passports to buy beer in Tennessee. It's just a matter of that you met an idiot cashier at Wal-Mart. If it happens again, you can ask to see the manager. 

A note about alcohol in Indiana, however. When you're transporting a closed container (e.g., case of beer), make sure it's out of reach of the driver. When you're transporting an open container (like a bottle of whiskey to a friend's house), put it in the trunk. Also, you can't buy beer at stores on Sundays, but you can order it from restaurants. These laws are unique to Indiana, but almost every state has their own convoluted alcohol laws.

Sifting your penny containers 
I noticed your post, and I have an idea about how to separate your pennies from the rice and beans. 

Ever had a lego box as a kid? Did you notice that all the small pieces ended up in the bottom? That's because when agitated, container contents tend to sort themselves by particle size. 

I'd dump all of your rice and beans and pennies into a larger container, then shake it up violently. With luck, the rice will go to the bottom, and the beans or pennies will end up on top. Either way, it'll be fairly well-sorted, and you should have no problem removing the pennies.

Both are reasonable. Both have very strong Nintendo histories, and both would have great stages.

With regard to Simon Belmont, imagine a Castlevania stage! Its awesome. Without getting into too much detail, one of my favorite ideas is to have a Dracula's castle stage where candles on the wall can be destroyed and items drop out. The candles would respawn after some time limit. Also, medusa heads would fly around occasionally and harass players.

With regard to Goemon, he's the perfect kind of character for Smash Bros--strong Nintendo background, over the top comedy, and a host of weapons. He'd use his pipe as a weapon, and he'd also be able to throw coins and bombs. One of his moves would be his chain pipe. Also, imagine an Edo castle stage! Spectacular. But best of all is his final smash. Impact!! Goemon would whip out his conch shell and summon Impact. He'd leave the screen, and as Impact you could use youth left hand punch, right hand pipe smash, or coin nasal bullets. And, of course, that iconic and silly Impact music would play the whole time

Katie, 

Ostensibly, the HAIMS deployment at Lackland is supposed to start in a little over a month. I have not received invites to any PIM calls. Does this mean that the training dates might be getting pushed? 

Also, has there been any word, yet, on the rescheduling of Dover or Edwards? 

Thanks,

This is how I romance: awkward silence and stilted conversation 
And that goes nowhere fast. 
So damn it all if I'm not jealous.

On Hell's Kitchen, most of the chefs are professionals who've been in the industry for years, if I'm not mistaken. They've reached a point in their careers where they feel like the cream of the crop who can do no wrong. They've hardened themselves to new teaching. So Ramsey has to knock them off their high horses before he can teach them how to fix the little things they've been doing wrong, probably for years, so they can reach that "next level" of being a chef. 

I don't think he goes about it the right way, but I think that's what he's doing.

I worked under a graduate student one summer as her "field research assistant", in the course of things, the professor she was working under came out to check on the project. The grad student gave a glowing review of my work. 

When I returned to the university that fall, I visited the professor during her office hours and asked straight out of she knew of any professors or grad students looking for an assistant/intern, preferably in my field of choice (marine biology; the professor taught/researched general botany). She offered to put me in touch with one of two professors who ran marine biology labs. I chose the one that most piqued my interest, and got a job in a marine ecology lab. I still kind of regret taking that job over one working in a lab that focused on sea turtle research, but that's neither here nor there. 

All that to say, schedule an appointment or go see the professor during open office hours (if they have any) and ask. Maybe be prepared to offer a few references and/or a CV if the professor asks for them? 
I'm wearing a plain green Hane's T-shirt. 

I imagine my power is something vague, boring, and botanical. 
So much this. 

I went to a show once. It was my first time seeing my favorite band perform live. It was also my only time seeing them perform live; this was their farewell show. 

So when the time came for them to perform my favorite song, I pulled out my phone to record a video. I knew it'd look crappy. I knew it'd sound crappy. I didn't care. I just wanted to be able to relive the show, and the video would suffice. But someone went out of their way to make sure that I knew they were scoffing and rolling their eyes at me in the dark, noisy, crowded club-venue. 

I chose to take that video (and not punch the jerkwad in the face) because I don't really form "visual" memories. When I try to recall things, it's like reading text off of a page. So I snap photos and videos of things I want to recall visually, like the light show at the concert or the way the band interacted with each other and the crowd. 

That doesn't mean I was any less invested in the experience or that I somehow wasn't really experiencing it. It just means I was recording it for posterity while I was experiencing it. 
The "draw eyebrows on baby" one! I can't look at it without laughing so hard I give myself hiccups.

I'll have to dig around for a link to the post, but a blogger by the name of josiahd posted (maybe reblogged, I can't recall exactly) something about how abusive people aren't incapable of loving their abusee, aren't incapable of wanting "what's best" for their abusee, can honestly and absolutely love their abusee and still be abusive, intentional or otherwise. 

This guys intent is not abusive, but his actions and attitudes towards his ex are, regardless, abusive to some extent.

A man with OCD recites a poem about his one true love. It?s heartbreaking.


To everyone who ever said ?I have OCD? just because they?re organized, tidy, super clean, meticulous?this is what OCD looks like.

How about we stop using that term so lightly.


This is a very good poem, and it?s a very good example of what OCD is actually like, rather than the weird pop culture concept that?s arisen in the last two decades or so.

But, speaking from my perspective as [metaphorically] the person he?s talking about, the one who was the ?one true love? of someone with a severe mental illness, ?You owe me love because it?s the only thing keeping me from falling apart? is one of one of the most unhealthy, destructive, and abusive things that will keep you enmeshed longer than just about anything else. Especially when you?re 14 when it starts. Especially when you?re developmentally disabled AND mentally ill. Especially when everyone tells you *you* are the REAL ?crazy one? in the relationship, and that you?re lucky to have anyone willing to put up with you.

This narrative isn?t extricable from society, or who is considered entitled to time, care, consideration, love, and patience, and who is considered the PROVIDER of these things, rather than the recipient.

It?s all well and good to applaud a realistic description of OCD from someone who actually has it, but this entire poem is shitting all over another person?s autonomy to say what she will and will not have in her life.

The reasons he was given are valid reasons.

Staying with someone because they think being with you ?fixes them? is, in fact, a mistake.

"How could she leave me when she owes me so much? is never going to go over with me. It?s the same old song with different lyrics.


He says he can?t understand how their love is now a ?mistake? in her eyes. And I really don?t get an abusive vibe from this as the way he feels is pretty normal for anyone who has their love end. Plus, at the end he actually reveals that his pain over her is ironically helping him to undone some of his rituals - he leaves on the light and doesn?t lock the door. These were things he felt bound to do repeatedly, so perhaps after her he will be able to become less OCD through his love for her, even if they never are together again. I think it turned out really beatifully.


I?ll have to dig around for a link to the post, but a blogger by the name of josiahd posted (maybe reblogged, I can?t recall exactly) something about how abusive people aren?t incapable of loving their abusee, aren?t incapable of wanting ?what?s best? for their abusee, can honestly and absolutely love their abusee and still be abusive, intentional or otherwise. 

This guys intent is not abusive, but his actions and attitudes towards his ex are, regardless, abusive to some extent.

The culture of the conference - I felt incredibly at home there with such a focus in this subculture . Schedule was great and manageable -- never felt like I was struggling through the sessions. The choice of speakers were great. Main sessions were total winners as well, really hitting on areas I encounter. There really seemed to be a consistent theme of the battle of the mind. Conference staff and servants were amazing -- really felt like I was apart of the experience with them instead of just being an observer. Having Pastor Matt Chandler was a perfect session to end the conference.

Its a personal and ministry development conference. Also, I'm working with Studio Red to develop one of our breakouts which is focused on visual story telling through film.. And all of life. If you or anyone else is interested... Let me know!

We noticed there's a grill in the front yard. Are you guys planning to take that up? 

The fan in Marisa's former room is wobbling at certain speeds. Are we allowed to attempt to balance it? 

And finally, is there anything we can arrange and help you guys out with your move? At your new house and here? 
Got it. No keys necessary in that case. I'll ask the guys if they each want individual alarm and door codes. 

Cool, I'll take a look at the fan. 

I'll check with the others about the yard. I'll let you know if anyone is up for it. I'll gladly help out. When were you thinking?

Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago.

If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society.
Where are you
Come to the coats
Downstairs before the main room to pray in
Hahah
Come down 
Go in and turn left 
I know I'm just yep

Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous.
Haha okay
Kay
Is this chando
Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Afif Mulla <afifmulla@gmail.com>, 
Most of us have been in a situation where they have found themselves wanting more with a friend, physically of course. For me it was my best friend which morphed nicely into a full blown relationship. 


Its not surprising that idea of a relationship like this is becoming more common these days. People are drawn to sex a lot more than they were 10 years ago. Industries like porn are booming, sex toys are slowly becoming something of a normal shopping experience. Sex is no longer a taboo subject area. 


So with all that taken into consideration its becoming a lot easier for friends to become friends that fuck. But does it last? Is it really that easy and emotionless? Or will someone end up getting hurt? 


How to get into that situation? 


Well unlike a relationship there is no commitment, you think just sex would be appealing to anyone, you're wrong. Some people know they are full of emotion and therefore it wouldn't work for them. Others feel that they could do it, but they probably will get attached and finally they are well up for it. 


Don't be mistaken into thinking someone who agrees to this situation immediately is the wrong choice. After all, they only want what you want emotionless sex. 


Unlike relationships asking someone shouldn't be a task, it shouldn't feel like a big deal, you'd be choosing a friend you wanted to have sex with already and if the situation is female to male I bet most males would jump at the chance. 


Is it 'slaggy'? 


Well of course you're a whore male or female, after all, you want your friend plowing you or allowing you to plow them, over no stronger attraction than just friends. 


If the word gets out, rest assured the opposite sex around you will be fleeing from any kind of relationship with you. Although it's not a taboo area, its still degrading that's something that will never be easy to remove from your mind or from society. 


Will this stay as sex for both parties? 


Haha no it won't. Eventually one of you will get jealous. Sex is the most intimate thing a couple can do. A physical connection like no other to each other, it creates emotions and feelings the body couldn't otherwise experience and if you're lucky an orgasm. Yes the passion of sex has been slowly pulped out over the years. But it still exists, and when your fuck buddy gets close and intimate with another person in a actual relationship you'll feel it you won't have a choice.

Hi Aunty Angela, 
Hi Aunty Angela, how are you today? It was so much great fun being with you on both Wednesday and Thursday nights! Thanks heaps again for the DVD stand! I love it, I even attached a photo of it with my DVDs in to show you! In regards to the movie we're going to see, Mum says we can go to the one at 12:15 tomorrow if you like? 
Yep! Cool! Mum says that's fine. I'm looking forward to tomorrow already! Thanks, glad you like how I got it set up! The bottom two rows are just CD box sets that I thought would look great there!

The second one wasn't about a fat guy but yes same idea. 
Indeed. What I was talking about comes more into play when someone wants to lose "trouble fat" aka that last sliver of fat that makes your abs stay concealed. 

Obviously people with an obesity problem need to straight up cut calories. I'm just saying other factors influence how quickly you can lose weight especially if you're body is well maintained. 
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, 
Should I overclock in a m-itx build (such as the Prodigy)? Because it seems like everything would overheat in such a small and confined space, but maybe I'm wrong (probably). Also, even if I don't overclock should I get the 4670k over the 4670 due to it being better or something? Or just go with the 4670? Also,c what's the best m-itx board for the 4670? One more question I have is, if I do overclock a 4670k in a m-itx build, should I use a closed loop cooler such as the H50 or will an aftermarket heatsink be enough? Thanks guys.
Best motherboards for a 4670k would be either the asus z87i or the asrock z87e itx. 
With a prodigy, you'll have more than enough room for overclocking. However, if you want a CLC, you might as well go for a bigger one like an h100i or else air coolers will work equally well for less noise. The Phanteks tc-12dx is a great cpu cooler. 
White cases are sexy. We need more good monitors in white to match them. 
If someone isn't saving money, they could still get a z87 with a locked processor for the extra features.

Par for the course with Google though. 
I also believe Xperia ZR uses that SoC as well. 
I don't want bigger batteries as much as I want good battery life. Unlike a lot of people here, a compact and thin phone is in fact desirable in my eyes. I won't buy a phone thicker than 10mm and bigger batteries also means longer charge times. 

Technically, we need new battery tech that has greater energy density. 

Also, battery life is like the one thing moto does well with its phones. 
Sounds like the moto x. I feel like they really missed the mark on price. 
A shitty one at that. 
I bought a 120GB ipod and threw my entire music collection on it. Then I realized I got skip syndrome because of that. Returned it and got an 8GB Sandisk and an mSD card and reorganized songs into playlists. Life is better now. 

Personally I just want 32GB on my phone. 





What is this nonsense? How am I supposed so how what is going on? 
Yikes. 
I still do. 
I still do. It is only on Monday. 
Really. I mean I would probably have to get to your house by five thirty but still

We have very few assault rifles as it costs so much in taxes and takes months for the paper work to clear. We have plenty of civilian rifles like the ar15 platform and other semiauto rifles though.

That and wouldn't those with said rifles be more likely to an apocalypse

No, I got the screw on top. I actually found it at TJ Maxx. Works perfectly fine for me. Its pretty sturdy. The green plastic is thick and hard, but it feels like the brittle type. It'd take a lot to break it, but I don't think breaking the handle would be out of the question of you dropped it from a fair height onto solid concrete. Its not Nalgene sturdy, but I can't imagine breaking it in any kind of ordinary way. 

Also, sometimes water can get in between the wood and the glass. There are air holes in the plastic on the bottom of the bottle to mitigate this, but if you get the wood soaking wet, you'll just have to take the pieces apart and let them dry individually.

Frankly, if they used rubberized plastics and rubber instead of the hard plastic and bamboo, this thing would be indestructible and totally awesome. That's probably go against their "green" bottle mantra, though. 
No, I got the screw on top. I actually found it at TJ Maxx. Works perfectly fine for me. Its pretty sturdy. The green plastic is thick and hard, but it feels like the brittle type.

Is it a coincidence that this flag is getting fairly similar to the [flag of Indianapolis](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Indianapolis)?
I really like it, but does anyone else think it's a bit long--wouldn't it be better with a bit shorter proportions?

Hello, I'm Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat on his brow? No, says the man in Washington, it belongs to the poor. No says the man in The Vatican, it belongs to God. No, says the man in Moscow, it belongs to everyone. I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose, Rapture. 


That was from memory. And I started playing BioShock less than two weeks ago. I just really love that speech. 


Also, as someone who has obviously played the first BioShock, if I just reached Heapheastos, how long do I have until I reach the end? Please don't spoil anything, I already know too much. 
Would you kindly is what Atlas from BioShock says time and time again. You even put a tm sign over it. And there is a person below who also made a BioShock joke.

Do you guys think this is a cavity?

Hello, 
A few questions about my teeth. 
Hello, I am here to ask a few questions about my teeth. 


First of all, some background. I am a thirteen year old male who has had braces. I still have wires behind some of my teeth in the front. I generally do a good at brushing my teeth, and have started flossing nightly after my last visit to the dentist. I have never had a cavity. 


Alright, time for some questions. 


Does [this] (http://imgur.com/H5Jc6PN) appear to be a cavity? I would find this very odd for I do not eat sweets and have always done a pretty good job at keeping my teeth clean. I also saw the dentist less than a week ago and she said that screening looked good, but I should floss to make sure my gums stay healthy. 


If it were to be a cavity, how would I go about getting rid of it? I really don't want to to have it drilled and filled, for it is only a tiny brown spot on the tooth. 


Are there natural ways to get rid of cavities? I ask because I have seen many articles about this. 


If the picture I have supplied does not give a good enough view, I can try to get a better one. 


Thank you for any answers you give.

No, I noticed it about two days after seeing the dentist. Also, a quick question. How serious is tooth decay? I've heard it can be fixed relatively easily.

Would you eat the bark or rub it on the tooth? I've also heard that cod liver oil can completely fix cavities. Have you heard anything about that? Do you think it could fix tooth decay too?

If you are planning on gaming, you will want a graphics card. If you can raise your budget to $1000, you can add a GTX 760. This is one of the best price to performance cards. You can run Crysis 3 on high/max with this card. 


TL;DR: If you don't get a graphics card, this will run nothing but minesweeper and Half Life 1.

I went with the FX 8350 for the 8 cores. My logic is since the next generation consoles use 8 core chips, many more games will be optimized to use them. This, if I am correct, will result in big performance increases in games. The motherboard was chosen for a reason. I plan on slowly upgrading this PC, starting with adding a hard drive. I want to be able to add a CPU fan for overclocking, more memory, and a second graphics card at a later point. This motherboard will allow me to do these things. The thing that worries me about the AMD cards is their age. Some of them have been around for a long time.
I'll admit the ram is somewhat expensive, but $30 for a power supply is not at all overpriced.

Walk Past me

As I sit here hardened by the cold breath of the wind I consider ending it all. I look down, two pound eighty three, barely enough to buy a hot meal. How did my life come to this. My dog cries a lonesome whimper, poor thing. He has barely eaten all week, he must be starved. I reach over and give him a pat, considering who needs fed more. A man walks past shaking his head. I look up to him, almost pleading, but all he does it tut. Does nobody understand? I think this could be the night, what is there to keep going for?
I study the sky. It must be about seven, soon the train will arrive from down south and I will be ignored by tourists and natives alike. I stand up, gather my belongings, my daily living allowance and attach the dog to a rope that doubles as a belt and go to the newsagents just down the street. One tin of dog food, a bag of crisps and the cheapest bottle of water in the store and I'm left with seven pence to start off tomorrow, if there is a tomorrow.
I walk back up to my lamp post, its flickering on now. I slump back down but don't plan on staying long, soon drunks will fill these streets and I don't want to be in that situation again. I find an old chip box lying on the pavement. I rip it open and spill the dog food into it. Its funny, this used to look disgusting, now it looks like a delicacy. I leave my best friend to tuck in while I eat my crisps.
A young boy passing by with his mother, loosens his grip of her hand and begins to run over to me. My eyes light up. He reminds me of my son. Before he can get too close his mother draws him back in line, followed by a lecture of staying with mum and not to talk to strangers. She speaks as if I'm some sort of monster, an alien scum. If only she would take the time to find out my story, all I want is for someone to listen.
Ever since I lost my job my life has been on a downward slope. When I was made redundant and I couldn't afford for my family I started falling into depression. My wife and I started arguing over everything and bills began to mount up. Eventually she divorced me. She took everything, my house, my car, my only son. The only thing she left me was the dog. I was left homeless and heartbroken. The depression only got worse.
Even after all this time I've never went off the rails, never hit the bottle. Never touched a drug. I've tried to pick my life back up but once you're passed rock bottom there's no coming back. I've considered suicide many times over these last few months on the streets, but I feel tonight is my final night.
I get up. Staring at the rope keeping my dog by my side. It's getting dark, I better find a bed for the night. Tucking my cover under my arm I grab the dog rope and begin to walk down the dimly lit street, towards the local park where my son and I used to play, before it was embarrassing to be seen with your dad.
The path to the park passes by my old house. I stop just outside. Looking up to my sons room, the curtains arse drawn over but I can see lights flickering sand changing behind them. He must be playing on his Xbox, he was never off the thing. The car is not in the drive, my ex-wife must be on her way home from work by now.
I consider going up to the door and seeing my son, he is 14 after all, he understands why I'm not there. But then again he might just get angry at me and I don't want that. I reach down into my pocket, my mind and heart begin to race. I pull out a note I wrote a little while back. My hands shaking I study the note in my hand. Tonight is definitely the night.
I attach the note to my dogs collar and walk up to the door. I take in one last deep breath considering my whole life. It all rests on this one final act. I take the rope off the dogs collar and I knock the door before making a quick dash for it. It will take a moment for my son to answer.
I hurry down the stairs after pausing my game of call of Duty and and answer the door. Instantly my old dog bounds up on me. This is odd, the first thing I notice is a letter tied to his collar.
'Dear son, by the time you read this it may already be too late. I just want you to know I will always be our memories together when we went out. This is nothing to do with you or mum. My life has gotten to low and I just can't pick it up. I will forever love you. This is not your fault. Love dad.'
I stand there numb. Dread setting in, without even grabbing my keys, I put the dog on the old leash that we still kept by the door and ran to find my dad. I had to stop him before he took his life. As I'm running I stop to consider where he might be. I re-read the note, 'I will always be with our memories together of when we went out.' It takes me a minute but I somehow feel this line is significant. Then it dawns on me. The old park down by the quarry where he took me to play football! Its about 10 minutes from the house. I begin to leg it to the park.
Finally, as I draw my last few breaths, I set up the rope on a tree branch high enough from the ground that I will not reach the floor. I think back through my life and what it has become. I begin to well up, tears in my eyes. I look over to my left. I can see the old goal posts me and my son would play football on. I was always in goals and I made a promise to him to come here every weekend and share time with him. This is the only place I still feel truly happy, even if the memories make me feel sad. I climb up the tree a little until I can put my head through the rope. 3...2...1...
"DAD!"

As I'm running I stop to consider where he might be. I re-read the note, 'I will always be with our memories together of when we went out.' It takes me a minute but I somehow feel this line is significant. Then it dawns on me. The old park down by the quarry where he took me to play football! Its about 10 minutes from the house. I begin to leg it to the park.
Finally, as I draw my last few breaths, I set up the rope on a tree branch high enough from the ground that I will not reach the floor. I think back through my life and what it has become. I begin to well up, tears in my eyes. I look over to my left. I can see the old goalposts me and my son would play football on. I was always in goals and I made a promise to him to come here every weekend and share time with him. This is the only place I still feel truly happy, even if the memories make me feel sad. I climb up the tree a little until I can put my head through the rope. 3...2...1...
"DAD!"

Whichever is cheaper for you. Either refund or sending another would be fine with me. 
Actually I would prefer a refund.
No problem.

Want one?
Yeah but my comments may have been a little different if I'd known ;) I'm happy to be mostly positive. I think it's a good step forward with it. That's true a good offline task can be handy. Looks a good list tbh and I hope your flight goes well. 

A 1.5 option if you like :D 

Haha yeah one or two purchases then :P
Hey Karen, dad says you don't want fajitas on Monday. That's cool, 
Hey Karen, dad says you don't want fajitas on Monday. That's cool, Nats will just get stuff for mum and dad plus her. You still want to do the BBQ? We have sausage but if you could get the burgers, barms and finger rolls. We'll get the BBQ this weekend I think. See you on Monday 
Yeah that's OK. Thought you would get it there. Yes we realise that but it will be ok in a cool box, don't think it will be that hot. 
Hey Richard. How are you doing? Just noticed you're at Patton Air. Went for an interview there earlier this year. If anything comes up I'd be interested at getting another crack at an interview. Just so you know I'm CIPS qualified now. 

Hope things are going well for you.

Hey no problem. Yeah that sounds like a good plan. You can always put 'to be spent on Denby only'

Well that's true but I mean, Staten Island has Dairy Queen. Or is getting one. But it's probably just as easy to go to Ohio.

I only saw one gecko when I was+there, lots of anoles though

Ok, I was gonna mention the show was moved to super late, but I'm still into happy hour. I'll focus on being extra drakee tomarrow
Till be there? 
I don't mind either of those things :)
I'm going to be there, I've been working nights :(
My beard is at ultimate gross stage, cuz I'm growing it (though I suppose you saw that Saturday), also, haven't drank some Sunday, yay
You? 
Cuz they don't know you failed at shower :)
Also, pops is playing at the riverfront tonight, a female friend will probably be there
No, shirly
Weren't you all I want to have female friends I envy you? She's about as single as I am
Sara? 
I couldn't handle that
My lie about mere poking
I'll Prolly be lingering in the area all evening
Oh, yeah, that's how I'd do it... 
Yep, on the river
Pretty sure one getting oysters, then I'll probably linger to iron hill
Sarahs doing happy hour, but gonna cut out early, I think Scali said fuck ten o'clock, Jon may be coming out
Anyway, you can try your magic of you want. I am pretty sure she gives everyone a date no matter what, I can't determine how she decides who to date again and fuck 
Yeah, me too, I'm Prolly getting drunk in the parking lot
Now she's hedging on coming out
You coming out tonight? 
Ok, whatever you feel like
Yes, thanks. 
Are you bringing people? Pops wants people if you know any, the late night fucked them 
Huh ?
It's so late :)

I'm home safe, let me know when you are lady. Thanks so much for coming out, hope you had fun
I will
You too 
Sweet dreams when the time comes, and good times until 
Ps, tell James he's a Cunt for not coming 
Even with a crooked face? 
So she's said to me
I'm so drunk, hope this drawing works
I'm home, she's at her boys, and she already said you liked her
Also said a 60 percent chance she shows on Saturday separate from me, but she won't bump Molly so... 
Huh? 
She said you smell bad, I assume you're out
Shirley griffens I think
Thinks what? 
Fucking pink shirt didn't believe we weren't when Shirley was trying to wing man it for me
She was like you have a girlfriend here, I was like huh, and she was like that bitch rubbing on me, and I was like in single, she was like oh, that game 
Yeah, that boy was a frined apperwnkry 
Like Shirley and I... 
I've never heard of a parent being accused of abuse for spanking unless they were the type to do kindly the time to the point that they were hiding actual abuse under the guise of legit punishment

I feel great 
Perfect amount of hangover to feel like rebirt

He's a good guy
She told me off for saying I was single in front of my girlfriend hahahahaha
But you were literally right there in the conversation.

Well it's lunch time it's gotta be close, if it's like happy hour, whatever
Omg, epic awkward couple photo

Which zoo? 
Bring your tiger poking stick

Who did? 
They DO NOT like each other
I didn't get close enough
It must be nice to be a girl, you get to rub on everyone and no one cares
Yeah, such an awesome super power
I face booked you the photo
Did we (I) not look like hell this time for the spark photo? Maybe we'll be in it
No, it's tall and colour full, and we looked each other in the eyes and paced together
Scottlan
I'd murder babies for the super power of welcome rubbing
You know it's true, I have no morals and like to rub...

I really like human contact
It's true
Pretty sure, ps, that may mean the bird collection is gone from the zoo
No, they were sitting bored

Yay, you can do them this way so we can still hit an hour that's happy? 
W3ll have to puzzle about it at a calendar while painting
I don't know 
dav
I like hanging out with you
It'll be the last time I see you for a while
But I'm super Luke warm about parties in general, I'm hooking not because I want to, but for a friend that's throwing it
Tuesday
The party tomarry? 
Don't know, Prolly nine or ten, wanna brunch? 
You know I love you, but if anything I encourage or watch bad decisions, I am not one to count on to look after, it goes against everything I believe in
It'd make me sad if you whined about it afterwards. So don't do anything you'll regret if you come please
I don't babysit out of love, not terribleness
That's not true, I hate it at times
I don't feel it's my place to control other people
I get hateful when others try to control me too
Live and fucking let live
You were totally anti that a week ago, but sure
I enjoy BEING a shit show, watching people I care about being one makes me sad
But God forbid they feel the same way and try to stop me. Cause moltent fuckin spite for trying to make me not be one
Nope, not at all. I think you're fantastic in spite of what you say
You spread joy, the most i
You spread joy, the most important of the ir

The youtube one?
Ps, I may not be a babysitter, but I hope you don't think I'm ever mean, judgemental or condisending, because I think those are trap sides of the same coin
Shirly is bailing for fear of making terrible decisions, so you may be in... 
Exactly my point. Those things come with the babysitter personality I think

The whole thing is better
You heard no dirt from me, don't make me lose disturbs because I'm gossiping for your sake

Jon
Heathers house is 1202 painters crossing chadds ford pa 19317, Jaime says you should pick her up and give her a call with ample warning that you're coming, if possible, and assuming you're still in newark
Of course, I mean the cock blocking would be ok if she bones me
But as it is, it just sucks
But as long as you're boning me, I won't gripe if people at bars avoid fucking me

We are, she's like a best of friends
It's frustrating that when we go out I'm cock blocked unintentionally
All of my friends are basically females I don't bone

Failed services
A lot of messages about them today 
Where is she? Faiths? 
Reddy was pukin hard, I made a new friend, and apparently I rub the shit out of shirly when I'm drunk
Jons like, I've hung out with you guys twice, and you're pawing at her hard 
No, just the one time I slept there, and that wasn't rubbing, just one long grope
Really? So much playful prancing
Odd
When I slept there, absolutly not
I am not concious of the constant rubbing, so who knows
How's your sister? 
They're still driving from nc, I'm picking her up like 330
Good. You were totally chill about it, but it stressed me
Jon was like are you serious, why do people think you're dating? I really was unawarw
So what do you have against him? 
On Thursday some girl she was trying to wing man for me was like you have a girl friend. I was like no, and she said I was lieing

Hahaha, so she can be all, I'm a married woman
Now she says, I was refering to her last time. 
Your party was awesome. As Reddy says, the best sausage fest ever
Apparently whenever I'm drunk I strait up rub her constantly without really even noticing
Yeah, you're the one that told. I probably should apologize and not drink as much around her
So at seven am, I was in my underwear on the deck trying to explain the blurred lines video to Jon. I didn't 
So at seven am, I was in my underwear on the deck trying to explain the blurred lines video to Jon. I didn't even do the coke. I really don't think I need it

Probably less than a line
Comply robo
Heather is offended I didn't invite you and says you should come. It's painters crossing

Isn't the fact that land use is the major cost reason to spend lots of money on the transport tech? 
To sleep on
Overnight with Ava at heatgers 
And catch up with Jaime and amanda
Yeah, it was an overnight 
Ava had an overnight at her best friends house
She's staying tonight too
And amandas daughter was a friend 
And Amanda and Jaime and I had things to talk about. Emotions and such
You didn't used to do overnights? 
You mis estimate the role Jaime, Amanda, or I played in her life then 
She begged for staying and didn't want people to start leaving 
Huh? 
I'd be shocked if a bottle of wine was consumed between the four adults 
Yeah, I got ya. But it wasn't 
The kids ended up sleeping on the floor (by choice ) the little kid ended up sleeping in jadyns small bed, I slept on the small couch and Jaime and Amanda the little one 
I 

I do adult sleepovers all the time. Because I'll talk until I'm passing out from exhaustion. Booze and sex not required :)
On couches
Cuz I run a high risk of spoon molesting... 
Well, I was basically avas step father. And jadyn did at least a dozen overnights at my place. Bella (amandas kid) was morbidly curious about me
I'm actually really good with kids because I treat them like people
Hahahaha, if you came they'd try to suck you in too. 
Bella didn't remember me at all, but thought I was avas dad. So she was cool with me
Tired is a necessity 
Hahahahaha, I know. 
Maybe adult sleepovers are a single parent thing? Because they were common from when I was little toi
So glad it stayed here. We are destroying it :)
Nope
Up all night to get lucky
