that we should 39
the number of 39
the treaty of 39
i would also 38
in accordance with 38
it is the 38
and i am 37
and this is 37
in other words 37
it will be 37
the basis of 37
the council and 37
the implementation of 37
ensure that the 36
in my opinion 36
in which the 36
the common position 36
which have been 36
a matter of 35
hope that the 35
it has been 35
member states and 35
of the member 35
to be able 35
area of freedom 34
but it is 34
for the european 34
have to be 34
it is also 34
needs to be 34
the importance of 34
the question of 34
to do so 34
when it comes 34
within the european 34
and that is 33
at the moment 33
european union' s 33
favour of the 33
like to make 33
on the basis 33
such as the 33
the course of 33
the establishment of 33
the european union' 33
the opportunity to 33
this is an 33
with a view 33
a view to 32
according to the 32
in this house 32
is not the 32
it comes to 32
the need for 32
the subject of 32
this is why 32
to be a 32
will not be 32
a great deal 31
also like to 31
are going to 31
by the european 31
debate on the 31

that there are 30
that we can 30
the context of 30
the next item 30
to deal with 30
to thank the 30
account of the 29
court of justice 29
i would ask 29
in the way 29
is one of 29
is why we 29
of dangerous goods 29
should not be 29
the debate on 29
the development of 29
the level of 29
in addition to 28

member states to 28
mr president of 28
of the eu 28
of this house 28

the case of 28
the united states 28
to make a 28
transport and tourism 28
which the commission 28
would also like 28
and home affairs 27
as soon as 27
at the end 27
european parliament and 27
european union is 27
i am not 27
in the context 27
in the course 27
is that the 27
item is the 27
justice and home 27
of this kind 27
point out that 27
the possibility of 27
the president of 27
treaty of amsterdam 27
way in which 27
what we are 27
and that the 26
believe that the 26
if we are 26
is to say 26
it does not 26
proposal for a 26
the council' s 26
the most important 26
we want to 26
and the european 25
as a result 25
by means of 25
from the commission 25
in this parliament 25
in this regard 25
of the structural 25
the transport of 25
to point out 25
would be a 25
accordance with the 24
i am pleased 24
in any case 24
is going to 24
is why i 24
of a european 24
of the internal 24
of the most 24
on the subject 24
say that the 24
small and medium-sized 24
that is to 24
that we need 24
the commission in 24
the european institutions 24
the form of 24
the quality of 24
this type of 24
to have a 24
we believe that 24
we have been 24
we have the 24
and social cohesion 23
as you know 23
because it is 23
by the council 23
development of the 23
economic and monetary 23
i am sure 23
i am very 23
in the committee 23
in the council 23
in this way 23
in view of 23
members of parliament 23
of the new 23
of the world 23
of this parliament 23
point of view 23
terms of the 23
that of the 23
the interests of 23
the lack of 23
the right to 23
transport of dangerous 23
we have a 23
well as the 23
which has been 23
which we are 23
and for the 22
and in the 22
and we have 22
end of the 22
for a resolution 22
for us to 22
in the case 22
in the field 22
look at the 22
of state aid 22
of the treaties 22
of the united 22
on the part 22
relation to the 22
so that the 22
so that we 22
that i have 22
that it will 22
the aim of 22
the field of 22
the middle east 22
the part of 22
the united nations 22
to the member 22
and the council 21
are to be 21
has already been 21
has not been 21
i think it 21
i would therefore 21
in the world 21
like to express 21
of fundamental rights 21
on the commission 21
on this issue 21
parliament and the 21
president-in-office of the 21
seems to me 21
the citizens of 21
the commission for 21
the commission must 21
the council of 21
the creation of 21
the majority of 21
the people of 21
the reform of 21
the role of 21
to express my 21
to make the 21
will also be 21
a lot of 20
and of the 20
and to the 20
as a matter 20
attention to the 20
aware of the 20
do not want 20
european union and 20
great deal of 20
if we do 20
implementation of the 20
in my view 20
in the commission 20
it is precisely 20
mr van hulten 20
representatives of the 20
that the council 20
that we must 20
the council has 20
the idea of 20
the process of 20
the whole of 20
the work of 20
there will be 20
to be done 20
we need a 20
will take place 20
as part of 19
believe that this 19
european public prosecutor 19
far as the 19
for the commission 19
going to be 19
in connection with 19
in the same 19
interests of the 19
involved in the 19

it is essential 19
like to ask 19
like to point 19
like to stress 19

next five years 19
of first instance 19
of the intergovernmental 19
principle of subsidiarity 19
regions of the 19
service provision card 19
the fight against 19
the next five 19

is clear that 13
it has not 13
it possible to 13
many of the 13
not only in 13
of a new 13
of competition policy 13
of economic and 13
of european socialists 13
of justice and 13
of member states 13
